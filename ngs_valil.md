__Fantasy setting and adventures for the [Narrative Game System](http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/128522/NGS-The-Narrative-Game-System) by [Venture Land Games](http://www.venturelandgames.com).__

Explore the most common clichés in fantasy role-playing, from rats in a basement to skeletons in a dungeon; use these tropes to explore the flexibility of NGS, and the very non-cliché approaches you're free to take.

This is a role-playing experiment, and the independent variable is the system. My hypothesis is that you'll appreciate NGS's simplicity, and your group will love getting right to the fun part: playing. I look forward to your conclusions!

Setting
-------

###Introduction

* __Structure:__ Valil is a medium-sized, town of about 5,000 people. Surrounded by a low outer wall, it's relatively well-defended against beasts and monsters, but it would fall in less than a week to an organized "army."
* __Guards:__ Valil is protected by 50 overworked "regular" guards, and 500 reserves. Many of the reserves only show up monthly training for their silver piece, but morale is high enough in Valil that a solid majority of the reserves see this training as their civic duty.
* __Government:__ Valil is a feudal society. The guard regularly patrol the city and haphazardly dispense justice to the rabble, but most disputes between peasants are resolved by an appeal to the gentry (their employers). Gentry appeal to nobility (their lords). The highest authority in Valil is the Sherrif, who rules on behalf of a distant King.
* __History:__ Valil sprang up alongside a river 400 years ago, so the structures by the river (docks, mills, warehouses) are the oldest. Moving away from the river, there are interspersed homes, merchants, and skilled laborers. Farthest away from the river are the silos, barns, corrals, and charnels that support the farms around Valil.
* __Map:__ No map of Valil is included in this supplement. Buildings, businesses, and residences are located where dramatically appropriate. You can improv geography with confidence, because this supplement will not contradict you.

###Big Events

* __Tyranny, _100 years ago_:__ The thirteenth sherriff of Valil ruled with an iron fist while his son toyed with dark forces. Many peasants died. The Tyrant was assinated; his son was imprisoned. His regime is remembered with shivers and ghost stories to this day.
* __Prosperity, _25 years ago_:__ The sixteenth sherriff of Valil raised taxes on the nobility and gentry, earning much emnity. But he used these funds to improve roads, fortify Valil, and double the standing guard to 100. Banditry all but stopped, and the security improved peasants' lives. After a few years, the sixteenth sherriff was beloved like a tough, but caring, father.
* __Abdication, _5 years ago_:__ The beloved sixteenth sherriff stepped down after an abnormally long rule, sparing Valil from his mounting senility. He sequestered himself in a monestary, selecting the head of the merchant's guild as the seventeenth sherriff.
* __Assassination, _last year_:__ The seventeenth sherriff reversed the taxation... merchants and nobles grew wealthier, but Valil could no longer afford 100 full-time guardsmen. Banditry rose. Peasants protested. Some nobles advocated for the return of the taxes, but most nobles refused. The seventeenth sherriff was assasinated in his bed.
* __Coronation, _last month_:__ The distant King appointed a new sherriff of Valil. The eighteenth sheriff, the first non-native sheriff of Valil in 400 years, arrived last month. Is he or she a good ruler in need of strong right hands to help set Valil right? A weak ruler to be manipulated? Another tyrant that must be overthrown? One of these masquerading as another? It's up to you!

###Rumors

* __Rat Infestation:__ Don't eat or drink anything from any Inn or Tavern near the river! The ships have brought in rats lately, and the riverside businesses are overrun!
* __Green Men:__ Hear about them caravans gone missing? It's little green men what done it! Caravans outside the city, going or coming, makes no difference! My cousin saw it from a distance, but he's sure: small green men burst out of the bushes and killed everyone in one of them caravans. All the coins, food, and weapons picked clean in three heartbeats.
* __Digging Sounds:__ My husband guards one of the gates to the city. When he's on duty, he has to sleep there. In the night, they hear digging sounds, deep under the gatehouse. Somebody is digging a tunnel somewhere. They've told the captain, but he thinks they're hearing things!
* __Tax Collector:__ One of the tax collectors on the waterfront is lining 'is own pockets, 'e is. Them poor fishermen is 'aving to pay twice, they are. 'Aving to burn their boats for firewood and go to work on the docks, they are. Won't be long there won't be no fish for no eating.
* __Haunted Dungeons:__ I've done a spot of time in the dungeons under the Sherriff's keep, and I tell you them's 'aunted! Ain't no floor _lower_ than the duneon, but a cellmate got 'isself taken! And we 'eard 'im screaming under the floor as summat carried 'im away!
* __Merchant's Guild:__ Men go missing working for the Merchant's guild, and they're as secretive as a foxes. They're up to no good, mark my words. No good at all.

###DC 21

* __Mundane Tasks:__ Men and women are just men and women... their capabilities vary greatly. Some are better fighters, talkers, thinkers than others, but no one is "superhuman."
* __Magic:__ Magic users are formidible, but not invincible. Magic users can cast a number of spells per day equal to the Intellect or Extraordinary check they make upon waking from a restful sleep. Unused spells do not carry over from day to day.






Characters
----------

###Archetypes

* __Warrior/Barbarian:__ _Physicality._ Defend friends and attack enemies with physical abilities and weapons.
* __Wizard/Magician:__ _Intellect._ Maniupate elemental, illusory, and arcane forces with diligent study and mental discipline.
* __Thief/Rogue:__ _Personality._ Blend in, strike, and fade away by reading and manipulating people and crowds.
* __Cleric/Warlock:__ _Extraordinary._ Call upon mystical forces to heal friends... or hurt enemies.

###Narrative Abilities

Characters should have:

* 1 __Major__ abilitity that derives from their archetype.
* 3 __Minor__ abilities that derive from their background.

These abilities can be acquired from several sources:

* __Mundane:__ _Physicality._ Trained. Relatively common abilities... archery, fencing, riding... learned from relatively common mentors.
* __Urbane:__ _Personality._ Cultivated. Uncommon abilities... passion, drama, manipulation... acquired through experience.
* __Arcane:__ _Intellect._ Discovered. Very uncommon abilities... spells, curses, rituals... learned from very uncommon mentors.
* __Divine:__ _Extraordinary._ God-given. Granted by a deity... who nearly always demands something in return: fealty, loyalty, sacrifice, etc.

###Health and Dying

* __Damage Instances:__ 4
  * __1-2:__ The first two damage instances a character receives are superficial:  bruises, strains, fatigue, etc.
  * __3:__ Only the third damage instance should be considered a "wound." Thus, any duels "to first blood" would actually be "to the third damage instance."
  * __4:__ The fourth damage instance renders a PC unconscious. The GM should rule when death occurs based on the narrative and the type of wounds inflicted.
    * _Note:_ When a PC is knocked unconscious in mortal combat, I like to ask the player to make a physicality roll... The character will die in that many "rounds" without treatment or healing (a character with a Physicality of d6+4 will die in d6+4 rounds).
* __Recovery:__ Recover 2 instances after first long, restful sleep. Recover remaining instances one-per-rest.
* __Healing:__ Characters who take appropriate narrative abilities can heal themselves or other charactes.
  * __Major:__ Restore 2 instances.
  * __Minor:__ Restore 1 instance.






Adventures
----------

These "adventures" are short outlines, with a few bullets on:

* __Hooks:__ Engage your players' characters.
* __Investigation:__ Facts for them to uncover.
* __Twists:__ Ideas to inspire fresh takes on old tropes.
* __Monsters:__ Information on the "bad guys."
* __Encounters:__ Sample encounters built and balanced using the monsters.
* __Rewards:__ Recommended XP and Treasure.

* __Haunted Dungeons:__ I've done a spot of time in the dungeons under the Sherriff's keep, and I tell you them's 'aunted! Ain't no floor _lower_ than the duneon, but a cellmate got 'isself taken! And we 'eard 'im screaming under the floor as summat carried 'im away!

Pre-Generated Characters
------------------------

Rolling your own characters is fun and easy, and no pre-generated character will ever resonate as fully. But pre-generated characters are a great tool for a novice or first-time players. I named the characters from a list of [Unisex Names](http://www.parenting.com/baby-names/lists/unisex-names) and avoided gendered pronouns, so feel free to play any character as any gender.



###Brett the Barbarian

Strong, but slow&emdash;Brett values actions over words.

* __Damage Instances:__ 4

|   Ability    | Die | Priority|Rating|
|:-------------|:---:|:-------:|:----:|
|Physicality   | d6  |   +4    |   5  |
|Intellect     | d6  |   +1    |   2  |
|Personality   | d6  |   +3    |   4  |
|Extraordinary | d6  |   +2    |   3  |

#####Narrative Abilities

######Major

* __Rage:__ When triggered, Brett enters a _rage_, an altered state of mind where physical limitations are meaningless. While raging, Brett may ignore damage, and re-roll any unmodified _Physicality_ die roll less than 4 (must take the second result). The Player and GM should agree on when rage ends under the circumstances, but once Rage ends, Brett is exhausted. Exhausted can mean anything, but I suggest: Brett loses one damage instance, or Brett takes a penalty on _Physicality_ checks (roll one die lower; if already rolling a d6 then reduce priority to 3, and so on). A rest or magical healing ends the penalty.

######Minor

* __Overwhelm:__ In the wild ecastacy of battle, Brett can overpower almost any adversary; spend a Narrative Accolade to deal damage to a foe despite a missed attack roll.
* __By This Axe:__ Recognizing that social "power" is an illusion, Brett may substitude _Physicality_ for _Personality_ on rolls to intimidate or negotiate.
* __Untamed:__ Brett's naturist, honest outlook cause some "civilized" people to romanticize him as a "noble savage." Brett can use this to win new friends and lovers.

#####Goals

* __Clan:__ Brett longs for a home, but "home" isn't a "place." Brett was raised as a member of an extended clan. Brett wants to belong to a group of people that are active, and alive, and always moving forward. That's "home" to Brett.
* __Revenge:__ Brett's clan disappeared while Brett was on an extended hunting expedition. It's been years, and Brett fears the worst; Brett longs to discover who's to blame.

#####Flaws

* __Restless:__ Brett is restless, even for a Barbarian. Fortunately for the other adventurers, there's much in Valil that Brett's never seen, so they aren't in danger of Brett leaving Valil any time soon. But Brett is prone to distraction: What's that over there? How are these made? Where does that go?
* __Show, Don't Tell:__ Brett has no use for words or lengthy explanations. "Save your words and _show_ me!"



###Casey the Cleric

Devout, but abrasive&emdash;Casey values conviction over temperament.

* __Damage Instances:__ 4

|   Ability    | Die | Priority|Rating|
|:-------------|:---:|:-------:|:----:|
|Physicality   | d6  |   +3    |   4  |
|Intellect     | d6  |   +2    |   3  |
|Personality   | d6  |   +1    |   2  |
|Extraordinary | d6  |   +4    |   5  |

#####Narrative Abilities

######Major

* __Healing:__ 

######Minor

* __Defend:__ 
* __Pacify:__ 
* __Bolster:__ 

#####Goals

* __Resuscitate:__ Dead citizens cannot serve the greater good.
* __Rehabilitate:__ 

#####Flaws

* __Gruff:__ Casey has work to do, and everyone else had better help or get out of the way.
* __Simple:__ Casey believes in simple, straightforward solutions. Unfortunately, it's really easy to take "straightforward" too far and border on "stupid."



###Sydney the Sorcerer

Brainy, but weak--Sydney values knowledge over strength.

* __Damage Instances:__ 4

|   Ability    | Die | Priority|Rating|
|:-------------|:---:|:-------:|:----:|
|Physicality   | d6  |   +1    |   2  |
|Intellect     | d6  |   +4    |   5  |
|Personality   | d6  |   +2    |   3  |
|Extraordinary | d6  |   +3    |   4  |

#####Narrative Abilities

######Major

* __Arcana:__ As a sorcerer, Sydney has developed the senses and knowledge to affect the very fabric of reality.
  * __Using Magic to Attack:__ When Sydney uses magic to attack another character, the characters should make _Opposed Rolls_. The defending character should defend with the appropriate _Ability_. For example, if Sydney tries to hurt another character with magic, Sydney should roll _Intellect_ against that other character's _Physicality._ If Sydney tries to stun another character with Magic, Sydney should roll _Intellect_ against that other character's _Intellect_, and so on. If Sydney tries to use magic on another magical character, that character may choose to oppose any spell with _Intellect_, as long as that character is aware of the attack.
  * __Hard Limitaiton, Scope:__ While Sydney can _affect_ the fabric of reality, that affect is relatively limited in scope. For example, when using magic to attack another character, the damage should inflicted should ahere to the _Damage_ table; there are no insta-kills because reality resists Sydney's (and, indeed, any sorcerer's) attempts to alter it.
  * __Soft Limitation:__ The GM and player should align on what magic can and cannot do, and both should be able to invoke that trust and alignment to prevent the other from "breaking" the story. For example, suppose the GM and player are not aligned, and Sydney is allowed to teleport people and objects. In the next combat, the players face off against a monster, and Sydney decides to simply teleport the monster's head a few feet away... the GM never intended the teleport spell to have that affect, so an argument ensues.
  * __Optional Limitation, Spells per Day:__ Every morning, Sydney makes an _Intellect_ roll. The result tells the player how many spells Sydney will be able to cast that day. Currently, Sydney rolls a d6+4 for _Intellect,_ thus Sydney will initially be able to cast from 5 to 10 spells per day.

######Minor

* __Ear for Languages:__ 
* __Quick Study:__ 
* __Useless Trivia:__ Sydney reads voraciously.

#####Goals

* __Innovation:__ Despite studying many, many ancient works... discovering new spells is Sydney's real passion. Sydney feels magic is too devoted to the rote study of ancient magical pioneers. Sydney would rather _be_ one of those pioneers, discovering new, innovative spells.
* __Documentation:__ Sydney worries that the society is too focused on ancient history, and not focused enough on the history that's made every day.

#####Flaws

* __Weak:__ Sydney's absolute devotion to knowledge and studying has created a sedentary lifestyle. Sydney struggles with any strenuous activity, including any hiking more difficult than schlepping a satchel of books across town.
* __Aloof:__ Sydney's interactions with other people have always been limited to specific roles within some rigid hierarchy: master/servant; teacher/student; merchant/customer. As a result, Sydney has no idea how to establish and cultivate peer relationships: friends, lovers, etc.



###Taylor the Thief

Persuasive, but skeptical&emdash;Taylor values subtlety over devotion.

* __Damage Instances:__ 4

|   Ability    | Die | Priority|Rating|
|:-------------|:---:|:-------:|:----:|

######Major

* __Face in the crowd:__ Taylor can disappear in a crowd, effortlessly blending in with noble and commoner alike.

######Minor

* __Flattery:__ Taylor knows that a few well-chosen words and the right body language can win many instant allies.
* __Marksman:__ Taylor's always had a way with ranged weapons&emdash;throwing daggers, darts, crossbows... you name it.
* __Actor:__ Taylor has mastered storytelling... spinning intricate yarns that people can't help but believe.

#####Goals

* __Retirement:__ Taylor has always envied nobles for their carefree lives of indolence, and longs to achieve the wealth to do the same.
* __Legacy:__ Taylor is on the lookout for a protogé, with a half-formed notion of eventually sitting atop a pyramid scheme of thieves and con-artists.

#####Flaws

* __Fortune:__ Almost nothing is as important to Taylor as money.
* __Glory:__ There are good thieves, and there are famous thieves, but there are no good, famous thieves. Taylor knows this, but wants the fame anyway.






Owning It

Customizing this supplement for your group...

* __Name NPCs:__ No non-player characters are named in this supplement; they are referred to by only by occupation or role. This makes it easy to drop any adventure into an existing campaign with existing NPCs. You already know the Innkeeper in your current campaign is Audric, so when you read "Inkeeper" you say "Audric." You don't have to remember that "Garett" in this supplement is actually "Audric" in your campaign.
* __Keep NPCs:__ Once players latch onto an NPC as a beloved friend or hated enemy, keep bringing that NPC back for the next adventure. Make them the villain. Give them a cameo. Let a Player catch sight of them in a crowd. But use them, because player love/hate is hard to create, and it's so vital to a good, fun experience at the table.
* __Draw Maps:__ Maps aren't necessary for this campaign, and I often run without them. But if you want to commit to a geography, there's no geography like your own. It ensures a proper fit into a larger campaign, and no map's easier to remember than the one you drew yourself.
