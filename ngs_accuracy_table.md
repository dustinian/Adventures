Opposed Roll Accuracy Tables
============================



Summary
-------

This table shows the likely result of an "opposed" roll; it may be helpful for building NPCs to challenge your PCs.



Detail
------

When one character attacks another, they make opposed Mechanical Ability rolls. Below, I've plotted the "accuracy" of each possible die (d6, d8, etc.) and Priority (+1, +2, etc.). For example, a character attacking with "d12 + 3" will hit a character defending with "d8 + 4" 54% of the time.

Methodology
-----------

I wrote the following custom function in Excel to calculate the results of all possible rolls in an opposed roll:

    Function AverageModifiedDiePercent(Die1 As Byte, Mod1 As Byte, Die2 As Byte, Mod2 As Byte) As Double
        'PURPOSE:
            'To output the likelihood (%) for an opposed roll in the Narrative Game System (NGS) by Venture Land Games.
        'VERSION (Version Number, YYYY.MM.DD)
            '1.0, 2016.03.20: First working model.

        'LANGUAGE
            'Excel VBA, but the syntax used would easily convert to another flavor of Basic (FreeBASIC, for example).
        'INPUT:
            'Die1: The number of faces the attacking die has (i.e. "6" for a "d6")
            'Mod1: The attacking numerical priority (i.e. "4" for "Priority A")
            'Die2: The number of faces the defending die has (i.e. "6" for a "d6")
            'Mod2: The defending numerical priority (i.e. "4" for "Priority A")
        'USE:
            'To use this function in your own Excel workbook:
                '1. Create a macro-enabled workbook (.xlsm from Excel 2007 and on).

                '3. Create a new "module."
                '4. Paste this code into the module. You can now call this function from your Excel worksheet.
                '5. Call the function by entering a formula like this:
                    'Use this to calculate a d8+3 against a d6+1: =AverageModifiedDiePercent(8, 3, 6, 1)
