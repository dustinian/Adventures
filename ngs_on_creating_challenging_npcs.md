Introduction
------------

With no library of pre-generated NPCs to fall back on, GMs may find that the bulk of their session preparation is devoted to creating NPCs. GMs want to create NPCs that will challenge the PCs, NPCs that are neither unstoppable nor pushovers. That desire begs several questions:

* __Mechanical Abilities:__ What die (d6, d8, 10, d12) should I assign to the NPC's Mechanical Abilities?
* __Narrative Abilities:__ How will the NPC's Narrative Abilities impact its effectiveness?
* __Groups:__ How will the number of NPCs affect the challenge of the encounter?

This essay gives perspective on each of these questions.

NGS is specifically designed as a "rules light" system. You can argue--and rightly so--that:

* I'm missing the point of NGS when I focus on analyzing challenges and crunching numbers.
* The average NGS GM will have no interest in the content of this article.

Both of those observations are fair, and I encourage you to abandon this essay now if you agree. I intend to follow this essay up with a series of pre-generated NPCs for fellow GMs to simply drop into their games with no number crunching. But I wanted to write this essay first... I want to  generate those NPCs with some rhyme and reason.
