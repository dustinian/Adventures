# Avengers Planar Incursion

## Summary

An Avengers one-shot using Tribality's [5E Avengers Builds](http://tribality.com/2015/05/03/avengers-assemble-character-builds-for-dd-5e).

## Setting

[Hammerfast](http://nentirvale.wikidot.com/hammerfast), in the [Nentir Vale](http://nentirvale.wikidot.com/setting).

I've wanted to run Mike Mearls' "Hammerfast" supplement for years, and the Avengers need a good, fleshed-out urban environment for their adventures.

## Hook

Mission from god(s).

Since this is a one-shot, the Avengers are already a team, members of "The Holy Order of the Shield." They're sent to Hammerfast by Abbot Nicholas the Furious to investigate a planar incursion detected by the seers.

## DM Notes

* Kleitos Caiside, a bitter warlock, briefly opened a portal during a ritual gone awry.
* A symbiotic entity slipped through, joined with Kleitos, and turned his bitterness into homicidal rage.
* The symbiote is using Kleitos to wreak havoc on this plane, sewing thieves, bandits, and wretches with its offspring.
* The symbiote offspring that Kleitos implanted in his first victim--his former manservant--is near full maturity. See the henchman under "Villains."
* Other, less mature, symbiote offspring are causing problems in Hammerfast as well. See the minions under "Villains."
* Are these symbiots on a cheerful, bloody rampage, sewing terror throughout Hammerfast? Or is the parent symbiote/Kleitos playing it safe and keeping the minions under wraps (but still with minor killings here and there), sewing more rumors than terror? You decide!

## Plot

Search and destroy.
The PCs will follow the trail of bodies and/or follow their investigation with city officials to eventually discover a group of minions, then the main henchman, then the super-villain himself.

## Villains

[Carnage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnage_\(comics\)).

I wanted a Marvel villain that's instantly recognizable, but hasn't been done in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, so I chose Carnage.

* **Carnage** (Yochlol; MM p.65; CR 10; 5,900XP) Carnage is a yochlol in stats and abilities only. Any flavor text or visual descriptions of the yochlol should be changed to fit Carnage's description.
* **[Symbiote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiote_\(comics\))** (Black Pudding; MM p.241; CR 4; 1,100XP) The symbiote is only fought after Carnage is defeated. A surprise "part II" to the big bad boss fight. If the players have trouble beating carnage, the DM could lower the sybiote's starting hit points, or even omit this battle.
* **Henchman** (Chain Devil; MM p.72; CR 8; 3,900XP) The main henchman--perhaps [Doppelganger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelganger_\(comics\))--should be flavorfully altered on the fly... chains become webbing, for example.
* **Minion** (Ghast; MM p.148; CR 2; 450XP) Thugs and thieves taken over by weaker offspring of the symbiote.

## Notes

* **Be flexible.** This is a one-shot, and it should be highly PC-driven. Keep them "on task" (search and destroy the planar entity), but give them free reign within that task. If they want to hit the taverns and look for rumors, why not? If they want to have meetings with city officials, sure! As long as the clues they get lead them to an encounter with with the minions, and as long as all roads lead to Carnage, reward their actions! In my estimation, the only real sin a player can commit in a one-shot is inaction.
* **Build urgency.** If your PCs waffle on their next action, or get into protracted arguments about what's next, describe the horrific atrocities committed by the villains during the PC's inaction.
* **Make encounters harder on the fly.** Start the minion encounter with one minion for each PC, and then have more minions join the fray based on how ably your PCs navigate their 12th-level pre-gens. Add minions to the Henchman or Carnage encounters as you see fit.
* **Make encounters easier on the fly.** The DMG advises 3,000 XP in an encounter for 4 12th-level PCs. I can't imagine that the Carnage encounter will be that hard for 4 12th-level PCs, but the Yochlol is technically 5,900 XP. Shave hit points or omit abilities to keep from overwhelming PCs.

## Feedback

I haven't had a chance to playtest this yet. I've not played 5E above 7th-level yet, so I'm not entirely sure on how to gage the thread a Yolchol or Chain Devil would pose to those 12th-level pregens. Any thoughts on that?

Any other thoughts/ideas/soundbites that could add those "Marvel" touches to this one-shot?

Thanks for thoughts, and I hope you can use the framework for a fun one-shot.
