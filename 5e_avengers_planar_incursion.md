Avengers Planar Incursion
=========================

_An Avengers one-shot using Tribality's [5E Avengers Builds](http://tribality.com/2015/05/03/avengers-assemble-character-builds-for-dd-5e)._



Summary
-------

__Mission from god(s).__ Abbot _Nicholas the Furious_ of _The Holy Order of the Shield_ sends the _Avengers_, the order's most elite warriors, to investigate a planar incursion detected by the order's seers.



Setting
-------

Any city or town, including, but not limited to:

* [Hammerfast](http://nentirvale.wikidot.com/hammerfast), in the [Nentir Vale](http://nentirvale.wikidot.com/setting)
* [Waterdeep](), on the [Sword Coast]() of the [Forgotten Realms]().



Outline/Antagonists
-------------------

1. __The Cult of Hydra:__ Like the second _[Avengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers:_Age_of_Ultron)_ movie, open in the middle of an action scene. This is an easy fight; a blowout to let players test-drive their high-level characters.
2. __The Covered Minions:__ Find thugs and bandits covered in strange, living cloth armor.
3. __The Armored Henchmen:__ 
* __[Carnage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnage_\(comics\)):__ One of the few Marvel villains who's widely recognizable, but hasn't appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
  * __[Symbiote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiote_\(comics\)):__ _Optional._ If your players easily defeat __Carnage__, you can extend the fight by having the __Symbiote__ attack them directly.
  * __[


[Carnage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnage_\(comics\)).

I wanted a Marvel villain that's instantly recognizable, but hasn't been done in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, so I chose Carnage.

* **Carnage** (Yochlol; MM p.65; CR 10; 5,900XP) Carnage is a yochlol in stats and abilities only. Any flavor text or visual descriptions of the yochlol should be changed to fit Carnage's description.
* **[Symbiote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiote_\(comics\))** (Black Pudding; MM p.241; CR 4; 1,100XP) The symbiote is only fought after Carnage is defeated. A surprise "part II" to the big bad boss fight. If the players have trouble beating carnage, the DM could lower the sybiote's starting hit points, or even omit this battle.
* **Henchman** (Chain Devil; MM p.72; CR 8; 3,900XP) The main henchman--perhaps [Doppelganger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelganger_\(comics\))--should be flavorfully altered on the fly... chains become webbing, for example.
* **Minion** (Ghast; MM p.148; CR 2; 450XP) Thugs and thieves taken over by weaker offspring of the symbiote.



Background
----------

In _Hammerfast_:

* __Carnage:__ A bitter, antisocial warlock, _Kleitos Caiside_, briefly opened a portal during a ritual gone awry.
  * A _Symbiote_ slipped through, joined with _Kleitos_, and turned his bitterness into homicidal rage. _Kleitos_ refers to his new "self" as _Carnage_.
  * Seers of _The Holy Order of the Shield_ detected the breach and alerted their abbot, _Nicholas the Furious_.
* __Three Days Ago:__ The _Symbiote_ started using _Kleitos_ to create and spread offspring:
  * __Henchmen:__ The _Symbiote_ offspring that Kleitos implanted in his first victim&mdash;his former manservant&mdash;is near full maturity.
  * __Minions:__ Other, less mature, _Symbiote_ offspring are causing problems in _Hammerfast_ as well.
* Are these _Symbiotes_ on a cheerful, bloody rampage, sewing terror throughout _Hammerfast_? Or is the parent _Symbiote_/_Kleitos_ playing it safe and keeping the minions under wraps (but with minor killings here and there), sewing more rumors than terror? __You decide!__



Plot
----

__Search and destroy.__ The Players' Characters will follow the trail of bodies and/or follow their investigation to discover a group of __Minions__, then the main __Henchman__, then __Kleitos__ himself.

1. Optional: Opening fight against the _Cult of Hydra_.
2. Briefing by Abbot _Nicholas the Furious_.
3. Discovering the __Minions__.
4. Discovering the __Henchman__.
5. Discovering __Carnage__.



Optional: Opening fight against the _Cult of Hydra_.

Villains
--------

[Carnage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnage_\(comics\)).

I wanted a Marvel villain that's instantly recognizable, but hasn't been done in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, so I chose Carnage.

* **Carnage** (Yochlol; MM p.65; CR 10; 5,900XP) Carnage is a yochlol in stats and abilities only. Any flavor text or visual descriptions of the yochlol should be changed to fit Carnage's description.
* **[Symbiote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiote_\(comics\))** (Black Pudding; MM p.241; CR 4; 1,100XP) The symbiote is only fought after Carnage is defeated. A surprise "part II" to the big bad boss fight. If the players have trouble beating carnage, the DM could lower the sybiote's starting hit points, or even omit this battle.
* **Henchman** (Chain Devil; MM p.72; CR 8; 3,900XP) The main henchman--perhaps [Doppelganger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelganger_\(comics\))--should be flavorfully altered on the fly... chains become webbing, for example.
* **Minion** (Ghast; MM p.148; CR 2; 450XP) Thugs and thieves taken over by weaker offspring of the symbiote.

## Notes

* **Be flexible.** This is a one-shot, and it should be highly PC-driven. Keep them "on task" (search and destroy the planar entity), but give them free reign within that task. If they want to hit the taverns and look for rumors, why not? If they want to have meetings with city officials, sure! As long as the clues they get lead them to an encounter with with the minions, and as long as all roads lead to Carnage, reward their actions! In my estimation, the only real sin a player can commit in a one-shot is inaction.
* **Build urgency.** If your PCs waffle on their next action, or get into protracted arguments about what's next, describe the horrific atrocities committed by the villains during the PC's inaction.
* **Make encounters harder on the fly.** Start the minion encounter with one minion for each PC, and then have more minions join the fray based on how ably your PCs navigate their 12th-level pre-gens. Add minions to the Henchman or Carnage encounters as you see fit.
* **Make encounters easier on the fly.** The DMG advises 3,000 XP in an encounter for 4 12th-level PCs. I can't imagine that the Carnage encounter will be that hard for 4 12th-level PCs, but the Yochlol is technically 5,900 XP. Shave hit points or omit abilities to keep from overwhelming PCs.

## Feedback

I haven't had a chance to playtest this yet. I've not played 5E above 7th-level yet, so I'm not entirely sure on how to gage the thread a Yolchol or Chain Devil would pose to those 12th-level pregens. Any thoughts on that?

Any other thoughts/ideas/soundbites that could add those "Marvel" touches to this one-shot?

Thanks for thoughts, and I hope you can use the framework for a fun one-shot.

#### Special Abilities

* __Devil's Sight:__ Magical darkness doesn't impede the devil's darkvision.
* __Magic Resistance:__ The devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

#### Actions

* __Multiattack:__ The devil makes two attacks with its chains.
* __Chain:__ Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 14) if the devil isn't already grappling a creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns.
* __Animate Chains (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):__ Up to four chains the devil can see within 60 feet of it magically sprout razor-edged barbs and animate under the devil's control, provided that the chains aren't being worn or carried.\nEach animated chain is an object with AC 20, 20 hit points, resistance to piercing damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage. When the devil uses Multiattack on its turn, it can use each animated chain to make one additional chain attack. An animated chain can grapple one creature of its own but can't make attacks while grappling. An animated chain reverts to its inanimate state if reduced to 0 hit points or if the devil is incapacitated or dies.

#### Reactions

* __Unnerving Mask:__ When a creature the devil can see starts its turn within 30 feet of the devil, the devil can create the illusion that it looks like one of the creature's departed loved ones or bitter enemies. If the creature can see the devil, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its turn.

If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or wood that hits the pudding is destroyed after dealing damage.

#### Reactions
