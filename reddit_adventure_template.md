#Valil

__Fantasy setting and adventures for NGS, the [Narrative Game System](http://www.venturelandgames.com).__

_Valil_ does its best to explore the most common tropes of fantasy role-playing, from rats in a basement to a dungeon filled with undead. I hope this series of clichéd adventures will demonstrate to you and your players the flexibility of NGS, and the very non-cliché approaches you're free to immediately take, with no flipping through a rulebook.

This is a role-playing experiment, and the only independent variable is the system. My hypothesis is that you'll appreciate NGS's simplicity, and your group will love getting right to the fun part: playing. I look forward to your conclusions!

##Setting

__An overview of the town of Valil.__

###Introduction

__Structure:__ Valil is a medium-sized, town of about 5,000 people. Surrounded by a low outer wall, it's relatively well-defended against disorganized mobs, but it would probably fall in less than a week to any sort of real "army."

__Guard:__ Valil is protected by a thinly-stretched regular guard of 50 people, and a regularly-trained reserve of 500 people. Many of the reserves show up to the annual month of training to earn 10 silver pieces, but morale is high enough in Valil that a solid majority of these people see this training as their civic duty in case of attack.

__Government:__ Valil is a feudal society. The guard regularly patrol the city and haphazardly dispense justice to the rabble, but most disputes between peasants are resolved by an appeal to the gentry. Gentry appeal to nobility. The highest authority in Valil is Sherrif Audric.

__History:__ Valil sprang up alongside a river 400 years ago, so the structures by the river (docks, mills, warehouses) are the oldest. Moving away from the river, there are interspersed homes, merchants, and skilled labor. Farthest away from the river are the silos, barns, corrals, and charnels that support the farms that surround Valil.

__Map:__ No map of Valil is included in this supplement. Buildings, businesses, and residences are locatd wherever dramatically appropriate. You can improv geography with confidence, because this supplement will not contradict you.

###Big Events

* __Tyranny, 100 years ago:__ The thirteenth sherriff of Valil ruled with an iron fist while his son toyed with dark forces. Many peasants died. The Tyrant was assinated; his son was imprisoned. His regime is remembered with shivers and ghost stories swapped around Valil hearths to this day.
* __Prosperity, 25 years ago:__ The sixteenth sherriff of Valil raised taxes on the nobility and merchants, earning him much emnity. But he used these funds to improve roads, fortifications, and double the standing guard to 100. The merchants and nobility earned back some the money they were paying in taxes by defraying the costs of thievery, and better security improved peasants' lives. A few years into his rule, the sixteenth sherriff was beloved, like a tough, but caring, father.
* __Abdication, 5 years ago:__ The beloved sixteenth sherriff stepped down after an abnormally long rule, sparing Valil from living under his mounting senility. He sequestered himself in a monestary, selecting the head of the merchant's guild as the seventeenth sherriff.
* __Assassination, last year:__ The seventeenth sherriff reversed the taxation... merchants and nobles grew wealthier, but Valil could no longer afford 100 full-time guardsmen. Banditry is back on the rise. Peasants were dissatisfied. Some nobles advocated for the return of the taxes, but most nobles shouted the fortifications that had already been made were enough. The seventeenth sherriff was assasinated in his bed.
* __Coronation, last month:__ The distant King appointed a new sherriff of Valil. The eighteenth sheriff, the first non-native sheriff of Valil in 400 years, arrived last month. Is he or she a good ruler in need of strong right hands to help set Valil right? A weak ruler to be manipulated? Another tyrant that must be overthrown? It's up to you!

###Rumors

* __Foul Beasts:__ Don't eat or drink anything from any Inn or Tavern near the river! The ships have brought in rats lately, and the riverside businesses are overrun!
* __Haunted Dungeons:__ I've done a spot of time in the dungeons under the Sherriff's keep, and I tell you them's 'aunted! Ain't no floor _lower_ than the duneon, but a cellmate got 'isself taken! And we 'eard 'im screaming under the floor as summat carried 'im away!
* __Merchant's Guild:__ Men go missing working for the Merchant's guild, and they're as secretive as a foxes. They're up to no good, mark my words.
* __Green Men:__ It's little green men what done it! Caravans outside the city, going or coming, makes no difference! My cousin saw it from a distance, but he's sure: small green men burst out of the bushes and killed everyone in one of them caravans. All the coins, food, and weapons gone in a flash.
* __Digging Sounds:__ My husband guards one of the gates to the city. When he's on duty, he has to sleep there. In the night, they hear digging sounds, deep under the gatehouse. Somebody is digging a tunnel somewhere. They've told the captain, but he thinks they're hearing things!

###DC 21

* __Mundane Tasks:__ Men and women in Valil are as men and women today... their capabilities vary greatly, and some are better fighters, talkers, thinkers than others. But no one is truly "superhuman."

* __Magic:__ There is magic in Valil, but it's limited. Magic users are formidible, though not unbeatable opponents. Magic can consume different amounts of energy at differnt, unpredictable times. Magic users can cast a number of spells per day equal to an Intellect or Extraordinary check they must make upon waking from a restful sleep (Intellect Die + Intellect Priority). Unused spells do not carry over from day to day.

##Characters

###Archetypes

Players should feel welcome to either customize these archetypes or invent entirely new archetypes with approval from his/her Game Master.

* __Warrior/Barbarian:__ Physicality. Defend their friends and attack their enemies with their physical abilities and weapons.
* __Thief/Rogue:__ Personality. Sneak past enemies and win new friends by reading and manipulating people and crowds.
* __Wizard/Magician:__ Intellect. Maniupate elemental, illusory, and arcane forces with diligent study and mental discipline.
* __Cleric/Warlock:__ Extraordinary. Call upon mystical forces to help and heal friends... or hurt enemies.

###Narrative Abilities

Players should choose primary narrative abilities that derive from their archetype, and secondary narrative abilities that derive from their background.

####Number

* __Major:__ 1
* __Minor:__ 3

####Sources

* __Mundane:__ Trained. Relatively common abilities... archery, fencing, riding... learned from relatively common mentors.
* __Arcane:__ Discovered. Very uncommon abilities... spells, curses, rituals... learned from very uncommon mentors.
* __Divine:__ God-given. Granted by a deity... who nearly always demands something in return: fealty, loyalty, sacrifice, etc.
* __Infernal:__ Harnessed. Dark or unnatural forces twisted or bent to serve their user... but these usually leave their mark.

###Health and Dying

The first two damage instances a character receives may be superficial: bumps, bruises, strains, etc. Only the third damage instance should be considered a "wound." Thus, any duels "to first blood" would actually be "to the third damage instance."

* __Damage Instances:__ 4
* __Recovery:__ Recover 2 instances after first long, restful sleep. Remaining instances recovered one-per-rest.
