#Valil

__Fantasy setting and adventures for NGS, the [Narrative Game System](http://www.venturelandgames.com).__

_Valil_ does its best to explore the most common tropes of fantasy role-playing, from rats in a basement to a dungeon filled with undead. I hope this series of clichéd adventures will demonstrate to you and your players the flexibility of NGS, and the very non-cliché approaches you're free to immediately take, with no flipping through a rulebook.

This is a role-playing experiment, and the only independent variable is the system. My hypothesis is that you'll appreciate NGS's simplicity, and your group will love getting right to the fun part: playing. I look forward to your conclusions!

##Setting

###Introduction
* __Structure:__ Valil is a medium-sized, town of about 5,000 people. Surrounded by a low outer wall, it's relatively well-defended against beasts and monsters, but it would fall in less than a week to an organized "army."
* __Guards:__ Valil is protected by 50 overworked guards, and 500 regularly-trained reserves. Many of the reserves only show up monthly training for their silver piece, but morale is high enough in Valil that a solid majority of the reserves see this training as their civic duty.
* __Government:__ Valil is a feudal society. The guard regularly patrol the city and haphazardly dispense justice to the rabble, but most disputes between peasants are resolved by an appeal to the gentry (their employers). Gentry appeal to nobility (their lords). The highest authority in Valil is the Sherrif, who rules on behalf of a distant King.
* __History:__ Valil sprang up alongside a river 400 years ago, so the structures by the river (docks, mills, warehouses) are the oldest. Moving away from the river, there are interspersed homes, merchants, and skilled laborers. Farthest away from the river are the silos, barns, corrals, and charnels that support the farms around Valil.
* __Map:__ No map of Valil is included in this supplement. Buildings, businesses, and residences are located where dramatically appropriate. You can improv geography with confidence, because this supplement will not contradict you.

###Big Events

* __Tyranny, 100 years ago:__ The thirteenth sherriff of Valil ruled with an iron fist while his son toyed with dark forces. Many peasants died. The Tyrant was assinated; his son was imprisoned. His regime is remembered with shivers and ghost stories to this day.
* __Prosperity, 25 years ago:__ The sixteenth sherriff of Valil raised taxes on the nobility and gentry, earning much emnity. But he used these funds to improve roads, fortify Valil, and double the standing guard to 100. Banditry all but stopped, and the security improved peasants' lives. After a few years, the sixteenth sherriff was beloved like a tough, but caring, father.
* __Abdication, 5 years ago:__ The beloved sixteenth sherriff stepped down after an abnormally long rule, sparing Valil from his mounting senility. He sequestered himself in a monestary, selecting the head of the merchant's guild as the seventeenth sherriff.
* __Assassination, last year:__ The seventeenth sherriff reversed the taxation... merchants and nobles grew wealthier, but Valil could no longer afford 100 full-time guardsmen. Banditry rose. Peasants protested. Some nobles advocated for the return of the taxes, but most nobles refused. The seventeenth sherriff was assasinated in his bed.
* __Coronation, last month:__ The distant King appointed a new sherriff of Valil. The eighteenth sheriff, the first non-native sheriff of Valil in 400 years, arrived last month. Is he or she a good ruler in need of strong right hands to help set Valil right? A weak ruler to be manipulated? Another tyrant that must be overthrown? One of these masquerading as another? It's up to you!

###Rumors

* __Rat Infestation:__ Don't eat or drink anything from any Inn or Tavern near the river! The ships have brought in rats lately, and the riverside businesses are overrun!
* __Green Men:__ Hear about them caravans gone missing? It's little green men what done it! Caravans outside the city, going or coming, makes no difference! My cousin saw it from a distance, but he's sure: small green men burst out of the bushes and killed everyone in one of them caravans. All the coins, food, and weapons picked clean in three heartbeats.
* __Digging Sounds:__ My husband guards one of the gates to the city. When he's on duty, he has to sleep there. In the night, they hear digging sounds, deep under the gatehouse. Somebody is digging a tunnel somewhere. They've told the captain, but he thinks they're hearing things!
* __Tax Collector:__ One of the tax collectors on the waterfront is lining 'is own pockets, 'e is. Them poor fishermen is 'aving to pay twice, they are. 'Aving to burn their boats for firewood and go to work on the docks, they are. Won't be long there won't be no fish for no eating.
* __Haunted Dungeons:__ I've done a spot of time in the dungeons under the Sherriff's keep, and I tell you them's 'aunted! Ain't no floor _lower_ than the duneon, but a cellmate got 'isself taken! And we 'eard 'im screaming under the floor as summat carried 'im away!
* __Merchant's Guild:__ Men go missing working for the Merchant's guild, and they're as secretive as a foxes. They're up to no good, mark my words. No good at all.

###DC 21

* __Mundane Tasks:__ Men and women in Valil are just men and women... their capabilities vary greatly. Some are better fighters, talkers, thinkers than others, but no one is "superhuman."
* __Magic:__ There is magic in Valil, but it's limited. Magic users are formidible, but not invincible. Magic users can cast a number of spells per day equal to the Intellect or Extraordinary check they make upon waking from a restful sleep. Unused spells do not carry over from day to day.

##Characters

###Archetypes

* __Warrior/Barbarian:__ Physicality. Defend friends and attack enemies with physical abilities and weapons.
* __Thief/Rogue:__ Personality. Sneak past enemies and win new friends by reading and manipulating people and crowds.
* __Wizard/Magician:__ Intellect. Maniupate elemental, illusory, and arcane forces with diligent study and mental discipline.
* __Cleric/Warlock:__ Extraordinary. Call upon mystical forces to heal friends... or hurt enemies.

###Narrative Abilities

Characters should have:

* 1 __Major__ abilitity that derives from their archetype.
* 3 __Minor__ abilities that derive from their background.

These abilities can be acquired from several sources:

* __Mundane:__ Trained. Relatively common abilities... archery, fencing, riding... learned from relatively common mentors.
* __Arcane:__ Discovered. Very uncommon abilities... spells, curses, rituals... learned from very uncommon mentors.
* __Divine:__ God-given. Granted by a deity... who nearly always demands something in return: fealty, loyalty, sacrifice, etc.
* __Infernal:__ Harnessed. Dark or unnatural forces twisted or bent to serve the user... but they leave their mark.

###Health and Dying

The first two damage instances a character receives may be superficial:  bruises, strains, fatigue, etc. Only the third damage instance should be considered a "wound." Thus, any duels "to first blood" would actually be "to the third damage instance."

* __Damage Instances:__ 4
* __Recovery:__ Recover 2 instances after first long, restful sleep. Recover remaining instances one-per-rest.

##Adventures

###Rat Infestation

* __Foul Beasts:__ Don't eat or drink anything from any Inn or Tavern near the river! The ships have brought in rats lately, and the riverside businesses are overrun!

##Owning It

Customizing this supplement for your group...

* __Name NPCs:__ No non-player characters are named in this supplement; they are referred to by only by occupation or role. This makes it easy to drop any adventure into an existing campaign with existing NPCs. You already know the Innkeeper in your campaing is Audric, so when you read "Inkeeper" you say "Audric." You don't have to remember that "Garett" in this supplement is actually "Audric" in your campaign.
* __Draw Maps:__ Maps aren't necessary for this campaign, and I often run without them. But if you want to commit to a geography, there's no geography like your own. It ensures a proper fit into a larger campaign, and no map's easier to remember than the one you drew yourself.
