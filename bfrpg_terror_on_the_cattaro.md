Summary
-------

_Terror on the Cattaro_ pits your players' characters against South African poachers and the terrified, starving gorillas they're trying to smuggle to Chicago's [Lincoln Park Zoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Park_Zoo).

It's 1923; the players' characters are aboard the [_S.S. Cattaro_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Frontier_(1922)), bound for Chicago, Illinois from Durban, South Africa. Four days into the six-day, trans-Atlantic journey, the gorillas escape from the cargo hold, kill a passenger, and throw the ship's passengers and crew into a panic.



Timeline
--------

What the _Non-Player Characters_ did, and what they're doing...

###Before

In the months and days before the adventure...

* __1923 JAN 02:__ _Chicago, United States_. Overzealous boardmember of Chicago's [Lincoln Park Zoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Park_Zoo) offers good money for black-market gorillas... no questions asked.
* __1923 FEB 18:__ _Capetown, South Africa_. Guenter Oosthiezen and his poachers hear of the rich American's offer, and take the contract.
* __1923 MAY 07:__ _[Belgian Congo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Congo)_. Guenter and his men finally capture several gorillas.
* __1923 MAY 22:__  _Durban, South Africa_. They smuggle the gorillas aboard the [_S.S. Cattaro_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Frontier_(1922)), purposefully mis-labelling the crate as goats.
* __1923 MAY 27:__ [_S.S. Cattaro_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Frontier_(1922)). The terrified, malnourished gorillas escape...

While the players' characters are having dinner in the _Galley_, relaxing in their _Cabins_, or enjoying the night air on the _Main Deck_, the __Gorillas__...

* __19:23 GMT:__ Break free of their wood shipping crate in the _Hold_.
* __19:26 GMT:__ Kill a hapless crewman that startled them as they explored the _Hold_.
* __19:38 GMT:__ Climb out of a small hatch at the top of the _Hold_, finding themselves topside on the _Main Deck_. They remain hidden in the shaddows, terrified of the people they see milling about.
* __19:40 GMT:__ Scale the railing, desperate to get to the "top" of the _Cattaro_.
* __19:41 GMT:__ Kill a passenger who spots them on the _Officer's Deck_.
* __19:42 GMT:__ Scatter after another passenger, who saw the attack from 20-ft away, screams: "It killed [him/her]!"

###During

The adventure has begun. If the players' characters __do not interfere__, Guenter, the poachers, and the crew take the following actions. These actions __should change__ as the poachers and gorillas __react__ to the players' characters' actions. If your group refuses to engage with the initial hook, the murder on the _Officers' Deck_, you might have them witness or participate in one or more of the actions below.

####Guenter...

* __19:42 GMT:__ Orders his men to search the ship for the escaped gorillas.
* __19:43 GMT:__ Joins the crowd on the _Officers' Deck_ to see how the crew will react.
* __19:45 GMT:__ Observes the captain's interaction with the players' characters.
* __19:48 GMT:__ Retrieves his own weapons from his _Cabin_.
* __19:55 GMT:__ Takes the Captain hostage on the _Bridge_.
* __20:00 GMT:__ Attempts to bribe the Captain into letting them recapture the gorillas without incident.
* __20:02 GMT:__ Hears gunshots from the main deck and curses the incompetence of his men for killing a valuable gorilla.
* __20:17 GMT:__ Hears gunshots from just outside the _Bridge_ and bursts outside to yell at his men that they'd better take the last gorilla alive.

####Poachers...

* __19:43 GMT:__ Head back to their _Cabin_ for their weapons.
* __19:48 GMT:__ Begin searching the ship.
* __20:02 GMT:__ Shoot and kill a gorilla that's climbed the fore jib on the _Main Deck_.
* __20:09 GMT:__ Encounter and threaten crewman who are also sweeping the ship.
* __20:17 GMT:__ Shoot and kill a gorilla that's climbed on top of the _Bridge_.
* __20:31 GMT:__ Subdue a gorilla that's cornered in the _Engine Room_.
* __20:40 GMT:__ Nail the last gorilla back into a crate in the _Hold_.

####Crew

* __19:43 GMT:__ Begin herding passengers and non-essential crew to their _Cabins_.
* __19:47 GMT:__ Begin sweeping the ship, armed only with flashlights and improvised weapons (pipes, wrenches).
* __20:02 GMT:__ Investigate gunshots on the _Main Deck_.
* __20:04 GMT:__ Spot armed poachers and watch them while hiding.
* __20:09 GMT:__ Confront poachers, ultimately relenting.
* __20:10 GMT:__ Return to cabins to guard other crew and passengers while poachers continue to search ship.



Getting Started
---------------

Starting your session...

###Introductions

Ask the players to introduce their characters. Do they know each other? What do they look like? What were they doing in Africa?

###Luggage

Ask the players to describe what their characters would have:

* On them at all times.
* Packed away in their _Cabins_.
* Stowed in the _Hold_.

###Money

There's no opportunity to make any purchases during _Terror on the Cattaro_, but your players might want to know how much ready money they have for bribes and such. When they ask about money, have them roll one d6 plus another d6 for every _Wisdom_ point above 10. Multiply by this by 10 for their starting money in US Dollars.

###Adventure Begins

>It's 1923; you're aboard a ship&mdash;a cargo vessel, the [_S.S. Cattaro_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Frontier_(1922))&mdash;bound for Chicago from South Africa.

>Four days into the journey, you find yourself up on the main deck in the early evening, just after dinner. The warm, equatorial breeze has made the night a heavy, sticky one. But it's bright; the moon is nearly full. And as unsettling as it can be to look around and see nothing but water... it's even more unsettling to be cramped below decks.

>If this is your first time buying passage on a cargo vessel, you're probably surprised at the crew. They're not at all like the crisp, helpful crew of a passenger liner. No, they're relaxed, almost lethargic. They worked hard to load the ship back in South Africa, and they'll work hard to unload the ship in Chicago. But the voyage itself is almost a break.

>You startle! A scream! Above you! Up on the _Officers' Deck_! You crane your neck... people on the _Officers' Deck_ are shuffling and jostling.

Let characters with a _Wisdom_ bonus (+1 or higher) to make an _Ability Roll_ to see extra details.

>You look up further... What's that? You see a dark figure on top of the bridge. It backs away from the ledge and you lose it...



Locations
---------

Descriptions of the _Cattaro_...

You should decide where the players' characters will encounter the antagonists based on:

* What the antagonists are doing...
* How much time has lapsed...
* How they're reacting to the players' characters actions...

If you can't decide, you might roll antagonists' locations (listed top to bottom, fore to aft)...

| d8  |   Location    |
|:---:|:--------------|
|  1  |Bridge         |
|  2  |Officers' Deck |
|  3  |Main Deck, Fore|
|  4  |Main Deck, Aft |
|  5  |Galley         |
|  6  |Cabins         |
|  7  |Hold           |
|  8  |Engine Room    |

###Bridge

>This is a busy room, but several features grab your attention:

>* __Control:__ A large, wooden wheel in the center of the room, with a huge, expensive-looking compass next to it.
>* __Communications:__ Another sailor is manning the wireless, clicking away on the telegraph machine.
>* __Engineering:__ A panel filled with gauges.
>* __Navigation:__ A wooden table, bolted to the floor, with one map clamped to its surface and several more maps stowed under it.

###Officers' Deck

>Lifeboats. That's the first thing you see when you rush up the narrow stairway. You'd seen them from the _Main Deck_, but now that you're up here... you didn't realize there were so many. All the lifeboats create lots of nooks and crannys for anyone looking for a bit of privacy.

Immediately after the murder...

>The crew are moving everyone away from the aft section of the _Officers' Deck_. You shoulder your way through the crowd...

Describe the murdered passenger's corpse.

The crew are overwhelmed by this situation. They should ask the players' characters for help. If the players' characters decline, the crew asks them to return to their _Cabins_. Events play out as described in the _Timeline_.

###Main Deck, Fore

>The fore of the _Main Deck_ is dominated by the jib crane, currently locked down for travel. You saw this crane working relentlessly when the _Cattaro_ was loading back in _Durban_.

>A rail keeps passengers and crew from going overboard, and another rail surrounds the _Hold_ doors, which cover the cargo stored below.

###Main Deck, Aft

>The _Cattaro_ is using the aft section of the _Main Deck_ as supplamental cargo storage. Crates are lashed to the deck in short stacks.

>A pair of anchors&mdash;starboard and port&mdash;are stowed here as well.

###Galley

>Low tables and benches are bolted to the floor in this long, narrow room. At the far end of the room is a compact kitchen with a sink, one large burner, and a small square of counter space.

>Nobody's going to prepare a five-course meal in this kitchen, but it's perfectly serviceable for making large pots of hearty stew or porridge, which, in your experience, is exactly what the cook does every day.

###Cabins

>The cabins vary in size, but each contains multiple berths.

Each player's character shares a cabin with one or more other passenger.

###Hold

>The biggest room on the ship... isn't that big, you decide. About the size of a good, long barn. Smaller than a warehouse.

>But it's absolutely stacked with crates and boxes with only narrow walkways in between. Each stack is held in place with thick cargo nets, lashed tightly to the deck.

>The smell is overwhelming. Warm, rotting vegetables. Manure and wet hay. You hear livestock bleating and grunting in their crates. It's the smell of anything anyone might want to ship crammed together in a warm, sealed room.

Smashed crate...

>The crate was beaten open... one side of it hammered away from the inside, exposed nails jutting out. When you peer into the crate, the smell of filth and spoor hits  you. Animals... large animals... were in this crate.

Successful intelligence check on the spoor...

>The spoor has a sickly sweet smell... it's the spoor of a herbivore.

Successful wisdom check on the nails...

>Looking closely, you see a few short, brown-black hairs clinging to one of the nails.

###Engine Room

>This small, dim room is someone's idea of hell. It's not just hot; it's a thick, damp, sweltering heat. You're immediately wet. You can't tell if it's because of the steam, or your own sweat. Coal dust from the boiler sticks to everything. You have to time your words between the HISS and CHUFF of each of the three steam cylinders in the triple-expansion engine. Engineerss scurry back and forth, adjusting valves, and shoveling coal into the boiler. One of them stops to acknowledge you with a nod, and you wonder how he manages to act human in this miserable place.



Antagonists
-----------

Adjust the number of _Poachers_ and/or _Gorillas_ up or down to challenge your players' characters.

###Guenter Oosthiezen

>You see a big man levelling his rifle at you! He's wearing khaki shorts and an over-sized khaki shirt belted at the waist... an outfit that serves as a uniform for various military and constublary services throughoug colonized Africa... _He'll have training_, you realize grimly.

Guenter Oosthiezen and several poachers are aboard the [_S.S. Cattaro_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Frontier_(1922)) trying to smuggle several gorillas to Chicago's [Lincoln Park Zoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Park_Zoo). Guenter's a good shot with his rifle, and his father taught him how to box. He's no pushover.

Player's characters are rewarded for capturing&mdash;rather than killing&mdash;Guenter, but he's eager for his payday, and&mdash;after all the trouble he's gone to&mdash;he's willing to just about anything to finish what he started.

###Poachers

>You saw these guys board the _Cattaro_ a few days ago, leaning on each other as they drunkenly stumbled onto the ship. But now they have pistols... you hope their marksmanship is as bad as their singing.

Guenter's men are his friends. They're not as skilled as Guenter, but they're loyal to him. They won't readily leave Guenter in a tight spot.

Player's characters are rewarded for capturing&mdash;rather than killing&mdash;the poachers.

###Gorillas

>__Seen from a distance:__ It's hard to see the dark shape in the dark night, but you get a glimpse when it passes near a light... _My God,_ you think. But for the proportions, this could be a man! It moves upright, but also uses long, thickly-muscled arms to propel itself forward.

>__Seen up close:__ _Gorilla_, you (realize/confirm). You've seen the illustrations; you've heard the stories, but now it's right in front of you, moving and snorting.

>__Spots a player's character:__ It looks at you, and you're surprised to recognize emotion in its wild eyes. It's manic&mdash;terrified and enraged all at once. It bares its teeth and springs toward you...

These gorillas have been captured, brutalized, starved, and nailed into a hot, dark, heavy crate for days. Terrified to the point of madness, these gorillas now see all mankind as an enemy to fight or flee. But aboard this strange, hollow, moving island, surrounded by water and heat and noise... there is nowhere to flee.

Player's characters are rewarded for subduing&mdash;rather than killing&mdash;these gorillas, but subduing the enraged creatures in this strange environment will be no easy task...

###Adventure Seeds

Continue the adventure...

* __Guenter's Revenge:__ If Guenter is brought to justice, he'll be a free man within a year; poaching laws in South Africa in 1923 aren't strict, and Guenter's family is well-connected. Guenter's experience on the [_S.S. Cattaro_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Frontier_(1922)) and in varioud South Afican jails will level him up.
* __[Lincoln Park Zoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Park_Zoo):__ If your players found Guenter's telegram, you might prompt them to investigate the corruption at Chicago's [Lincoln Park Zoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Park_Zoo) that would lead to the Zoo paying for poached animals.
* __Poaching:__ If your players are outraged by the poaching, you might send them back to Africa to deal with poachers at the source.



Background
----------

Familiarize yourself with the era, the ship, the crew, and the passengers...

###1923

* __America:__ [The 1920s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920s) were a period of economic, artistic, and political boom following the end of the [Great War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I). The national [prohibition of alcohol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States) has been in place since 1919. Refugees from Eastern Europe have sparked national debate on what will become the [Immigration Act of 1924](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1924).
* __South Africa:__ The [Union of South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_South_Africa) is a self-governing dominion of the British Empire. The official languages are Dutch and English (Afrikaans won't be recognized until 1925). Jan Smuts is the Prime Minister, and the currency is the South African Pound (exchanged for about $5 US).

###S.S. Cattaro

The [S.S. Cattaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Frontier_(1922)) is a German cargo vessel. It's the only vessel leaving from South Africa this month that's headed directly for Chicago through the [St. Lawrence River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lawrence_Seaway) and [Welland Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welland_Canal).

* __Owner:__ Memeler Schiffswerke, Lindenau &amp; Co.
* __Age:__ Just a year old, completed in 1922.
* __Dimensions:__ 227-ft long, 34-ft wide, and 20-ft deep.
* __Propulsion:__ Coal-burning, [triple-expansion steam engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_steam_engine) with one propeller.

###Crew

Tips for role-playing the crew:

* __Language:__ Most of the German crew speak English, but all can understand Afrikaans (a dialect of Dutch not yet recognized as its own language) with some difficulty.
* __Politics:__ Keep in mind that the 1920s were a boom for almost everyone _but_ the Germans. After The Great War, the German government took on tremendous debt under the treaty of Versailles. This leaves many Germans poor, dissafected, and ripe for the new, aggressive Nazi Party (active since 1920, but won't sieze power until 1933). The crew may resent player characters who appear wealthy.
* __Individual Officers/Crew:__ You might use characters from a favorite book, movie, or TV show to stand in for the ship's crew. For example, give the cast of _The Office_ new names and German accents, and use them as a hapless crew that need all the help they can get.

###Passengers

The players' characters and the poachers are passengers, but there are additional passengers. Tips for role-playing passengers:

* __Common:__ Passengers were common on cargo vessels: Captains were encouraged to squeeze value out of every leg of every trip, so they made sure they sould every square foot of cargo space... and every bed, bunk, and berth. This is before personal lawsuits forced companies to limit liability.
* __Few:__ But "common" does not mean "plentiful." There simply aren't that many bunks on a cargo vessel. Between the players' characters... there may be a dozen other passengers.
* __Individual Passengers:__ Again, use small groups of characters from a favorite book, movie, or TV show to stand in for the passengers travelling together. Be sure to pull passengers from several sources... a few from this book... a few from that show.

Props
-----

Optional hand-outs...

###Guenter's Wallet

Reveals Guenter's name, origin, and goal. Use an old wallet, or [make a wallet out of construction paper](http://www.instructables.com/id/Paper-Wallet/).

It may contain...

* __Ticket:__ Reveals Guenter's destination and cabin number.
* __Telegram:__ Reveals Guenter's goal. May reveal that the "monsters" are gorillas. Print a [telegram template](https://www.google.com/search?q=telegram+template) on the thinnest, cheapest paper you can find.
* __Identication:__ Reveals Guenter's name.
* __Family photo:__ Humanizes Guenter. Print a [1913 family photo](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=1913+family+photo) on card stock, then varnish with polyacrylic.
* __Cash:__ Adds verisimilitude. Print [images of South African Pounds](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=south+african+pound) on parchment paper and cut them out.

It may be found...

* On Guenter's body.
* In Guenter's _Cabin_.
* Around the shipping crate.

###Shipping Receipt

Reveals Guenter claimed to be transporting goats... proof that he's smuggling the gorillas.

There are three copies of the receipt. They may be found...

* __Handling Copy:__ Stapled to the crate.
* __Manifest Copy:__ Tucked into the ship's manifest on the _Bridge_ (along with every other receipt from every other crate, so you might consider asking for an _Ability Roll_ to locate it).
* __Owner Copy:__ Tucked away in Guenter's cabin or on Guenter's person.

Print a basic receipt template, and use a fountain pen to fill it in with impeccable handwriting. If you don't have a fountain pen, consider using a very fine paintbrush and watered-down black paint.
