####Trap

Several boards have rotted through where the characters step off the ladder. Each character over 80 pounds that steps off the ladder has a 50% chance (1-3 on 1d6) of falling through the floor. A successful save vs. Death Ray (modified by Dexterity) results in no damage as the character catches him- or her-self chest-deep in the hole. A failed save results in 1d10 falling damage and a character-sized hole in the floor.
