Read before running _Terror on the Cattaro_!

###Summary

_Terror on the Cattaro_ pits your player characters against South African poachers and the terrified, starving gorillas they're trying to smuggle to Chicago's [Licoln Park Zoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Park_Zoo).

It's 1923; the players' characters are aboard the _S.S. Cattaro_, bound for Chicago, IL from Durban, South Africa. Four days into the six-day trans-Atlantic journey, poached gorillas escape from the cargo hold,  kill a passenger, and throw the ship's passengers and crew into a panic.

###Timeline

Events leading to the adventure:

* __January 2, 1923:__ An overzealous boardmember of Chicago's [Lincoln Park Zoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Park_Zoo) offers good money for black-market gorillas delivered before the fourth of July... no questions asked.
* __January 30, 1923:__ In Capetown, South Africa, Guenter Oosthiezen and his poachers hear of the rich American's offer, and take the contract.
* __May 7, 1923:__ Guenter and his men finally capture several gorillas in the [Belgian Congo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Congo).
* __May 22, 1923:__  In Durban, South Africa, Guenter and his men load the gorillas into a wooden crate and onto the _S.S. Cattaro_, purposefully mis-labelling them as goats to avoid exotic animal taxes, tariffs, and prohibitions.
* __Today, May 27, 1923:__ Four days into the trans-Atlantic journey, the terrified, malnourished gorillas escape...



Background
----------

Familiarize yourself with the era, the ship, the crew, and the passengers to help you improvise at the table!

###1923

* __America:__ [The 1920s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920s) were a period of economic, artistic, and political boom following the end of the [Great War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I). The national [prohibition of alcohol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States) has been in place since 1919. Refugees from Eastern Europe have sparked national debate on what will become the [Immigration Act of 1924](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1924).
* __South Africa:__ The [Union of South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_South_Africa) is a self-governing dominion of the British Empire. The official languages are Dutch and English (Afrikaans won't be recognized until 1925). Jan Smuts is the Prime Minister, and the currency is the South African Pound (exchanged for about $5 US).

###S.S. Cattaro

The [S.S. Cattaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Frontier_(1922)) is a German cargo vessel.

* __Owner:__ Memeler Schiffswerke, Lindenau &amp; Co.
* __Age:__ Just a year old, completed in 1922.
* __Dimensions:__ 227-ft long, 34-ft wide, and 20-ft deep.
* __Propulsion:__ Coal-burning triple-expansion steam engine with one propeller.

###Crew

Tips for role-playing the crew:

* __Language:__ Most of the German crew speak English, but all can understand Afrikaans (a dialect of Dutch not yet recognized as its own language) with some difficulty.
* __Politics:__ Keep in mind that the 1920s were a boom for almost everyone _but_ the Germans. After The Great War, the German government took on tremendous debt under the treaty of Versailles. This leaves many Germans poor, dissafected, and ripe for the new, aggressive Nazi Party (active since 1920, but won't sieze power until 1933). The crew may resent player characters who appear wealthy.
* __Individual Officers/Crew:__ You might use characters from a favorite book, movie, or TV show to stand in for the ship's crew. For example, give the cast of _The Office_ new names and German accents, and use them as a hapless crew that need all the help they can get.

###Passengers

The players' characters and the poachers are passengers, but there are additional passengers. Tips for role-playing passengers:

* __Common:__ Passengers were common on cargo vessels: Captains were encouraged to squeeze value out of every leg of every trip, so they made sure they sould every square foot of cargo space... and every bed, bunk, and berth. This is before personal lawsuits forced companies to limit liability.
* __Few:__ But "common" does not mean "plentiful." There simply aren't that many bunks on a cargo vessel. Between the players' characters... there may be a dozen other passengers.
* __Individual Passengers:__ Again, use small groups of characters from a favorite book, movie, or TV show to stand in for the passengers travelling together. Be sure to pull passengers from several sources... a few from this book... a few from that show.

Villains

Adjust the number of _Poachers_ and/or _Gorillas_ up or down to challenge your players' characters.

###Guenter Oosthiezen

>You see a big man levelling his rifle at you! He's wearing khaki shorts and an over-sized khaki shirt belted at the waist... an outfit that serves as a uniform for various military and constublary services throughoug colonized Africa... _He'll have training_, you realize grimly.

Guenter Oosthiezen and several poachers are aboard the _S.S. Cattaro_ trying to smuggle several gorillas to the Chicago Zoo. Guenter's a good shot with his rifle, and his father taught him how to box. He's no pushover.

Player's characters are rewarded for capturing&mdash;rather than killing&mdash;Guenter, but he's eager for his payday, and&mdash;after all the trouble he's gone to&mdash;he's willing to just about anything to finish what he started.

###Poachers

>You saw these guys board the _Cattaro_ a few days ago, leaning on each other as they drunkenly stumbled onto the ship. But now they have pistols... you hope their marksmanship is as bad as their singing.

Guenter's men are his friends. They're not as skilled as Guenter, but they're loyal to him. They won't readily leave Guenter in a tight spot.

Player's characters are rewarded for capturing&mdash;rather than killing&mdash;the poachers.

###Gorillas

>__Seen from a distance:__ It's hard to see the dark shape in the dark night, but you get a glimpse when it passes near a light... _My God,_ you think. But for the proportions, this could be a man! It moves upright, but also uses long, thickly-muscled arms to propel itself forward.

>__Seen up close:__ _Gorilla_, you (realize/confirm). You've seen the illustrations; you've heard the stories, but now it's right in front of you, moving and snorting.

>__Spots a player's character:__ It looks at you, and you're surprised to recognize emotion in its wild eyes. It's manic&mdash;terrified and enraged all at once. It bares its teeth and springs toward you...

These gorillas have been captured, brutalized, starved, and nailed into a hot, dark, heavy crate for days. Terrified to the point of madness, these gorillas now see all mankind as an enemy to fight or flee. But aboard this strange, hollow, moving island, surrounded by water and heat and noise... there is nowhere to flee.

Player's characters are rewarded for subduing&mdash;rather than killing&mdash;these gorillas, but subduing the enraged creatures in this strange environment will be no easy task...

###Adventure Seeds

Are your players eager to continue the adventure?

* __Guenter's Revenge:__ If Guenter is brought to justice, he'll be a free man within a year; poaching laws in South Africa in 1923 aren't strict, and Guenter's family is well-connected. Guenter's experience on the _S.S. Cattaro_ and in varioud South Afican jails will level him up.
* __Lincoln Park Zoo:__ If your players found Guenter's telegram, you might prompt them to investigate the corruption at Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo that would lead to the Zoo paying for poached animals.
* __Poaching:__ If your players are outraged by the poaching, you might send them back to Africa to deal with poachers at the source.
