###Gorillas

3 Gorillas are nailed into a crate in the cargo hold. The crate is much too small for the gorillas, and they're each painfully muzzled. Panicked and enraged, the adventure begins when the three gorillas break free.

####Trap

Several boards have rotted through where the characters step off the ladder. Each character over 80 pounds that steps off the ladder has a 50% chance (1-3 on 1d6) of falling through the floor. A successful save vs. Death Ray (modified by Dexterity) results in no damage as the character catches him- or her-self chest-deep in the hole. A failed save results in 1d10 falling damage and a character-sized hole in the floor.



Conclusion
----------

__Experience Points:__ Each Gorilla is worth 240 XP.
