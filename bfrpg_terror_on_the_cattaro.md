Game Master Information

Read before running _Terror on the Cattaro_!

###Summary

_Terror on the Cattaro_ pits your player characters against South African poachers and the terrified, starving gorillas they're trying to smuggle to the Chicago Zoo.

The player characters find themselves aboard the _SS Cattaro_ in 1923. The _Cattaro_ is bound for Chicago, IL from Durban, South Africa. Four days into the six-day trans-Atlantic journey, poached gorillas escaped from the cargo hold,  killed a passenger, and threw the ship's passengers and crew into a panic.

###Timeline

Events leading to the adventure:

* __January 2, 1923;__ _Chicago, IL:_ An overzealous boardmember of Chicago's [Lincoln Park Zoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Park_Zoo) puts out the word that he'll pay good money for gorillas delivered before the fourth of July... no questions asked.
* __January 30, 1923;__ _Capetown, South Africa:_ Guenter Oosthiezen and his cronies hear of the rich American's offer, and offer to take the contract.
* __February 18, 1923;__ _Capetown, South Africa:_ Guenter wins the contract.
* __February 21, 1923;__ _Capetown, South Africa:_ Guenter and his men head north to the [Belgian Congo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Congo).
* __May 17, 1923;__ _Belgian Congo:_ Guenter and his men finally capture several gorillas.
* __May 22, 1923;__ _Durban, South Africa:_ Guenter and his men load the gorillas into a wooden crate, purposefully mis-labelling them as goats to avoid exotic animal taxes, tariffs, and prohibitions. The crate is loaded onto the _S.S. Cattaro_.
* __May 23, 1923;__ _S.S. Cattaro:_ The ship departs Durban, South Africa for Chicago IL.
* __Today, May 27, 1923;__ _S.S. Cattaro:_ The terrified, malnourished gorillas escape...

Background
----------

###Era

The world in 1923.

* __America:__ [The 1920s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920s) were a period of economic, artistic, and political boom following the end of the [Great War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I). The national [prohibition of alcohol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States) has been in place since 1919. Refugees from Eastern Europe have sparked national debate on what will become the [Immigration Act of 1924](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1924).
* __South Africa:__ The [Union of South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_South_Africa) is a self-governing dominion of the British Empire. The official languages are Dutch and English (Afrikaans won't be recognized until 1925). Jan Smuts is the Prime Minister, and the currency is the South African Pound (exchanged for about $5 US).

###Cattaro

* __Origin:__ [The Cattaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Frontier_(1922)) is a German cargo vessel, owned by Memeler Schiffswerke, Lindenau &amp; Co. She's just a year old, completed in 1922.
* __Dimensions:__ 227-ft long, 34-ft wide, and 20-ft deep.
* __Propulsion:__ She's powered by a triple-expansion steam engine with one propeller.

###Crew

* __Language:__ Most of the German crew speak English, but all can understand Afrikaans with some difficulty.
* __Politics:__ Keep in mind that the 1920s were a boom for almost everyone but the Germans. After The Great War, the German government took on tremendous debt under the treaty of Versailles. This leaves many Germans poor, dissafected, and ripe for the new, aggressive Nazi Party (active since 1920, but won't sieze power until 1933). The crew may resent player characters who appear wealthy.
* __Role Play:__ Rather than listing individual crew members for you to try and remember (or worse, have to look up during the game), let me just give you this advice:
  * Choose a "crew" or "team" from one of your favorite books, movies, or TV shows&emdash;one that best represents the "tone" of your game. Suggestions:
    * _Star Trek_
    * _Firefly_
    * _Babylon 5_
    * _CSI_
  * Jot down new names for the crew (see the _Popular Names_ section).
  * Now you only need one scrap piece of paper to remind you of the crew's new names, because descriptions, accents, quotes, and motivation should all come easily!

###Poachers

4 poachers... Guenter and his three henchmen... are aboard the _Cattaro_. They are trying to smuggle three gorillas to the Chicago Zoo.

###Gorillas

3 Gorillas are nailed into a crate in the cargo hold. The crate is much too small for the gorillas, and they're each painfully muzzled. Panicked and enraged, the adventure begins when the three gorillas break free.

Conclusion
----------

###Experience

* __Each Gorilla:__ Killed, 240 XP. Subdued and returned to the wild, 480 XP.
* __Each Poacher:__ Killed, 25 XP. Captured and brought to justice, 50 XP.
* __Gunter Oosthiezen:__ Killed, 75 XP. Captured and brought to justice, 150 XP.

###Adventure Seeds

Are your players eager to continue the adventure?

* __Gunter's Revenge:__ If Gunter is brought to justice, he'll be a free man within a year; poaching laws in South Africa in 1923 aren't strict, and Gunter's family is well-connected. Gunter's experience on the _Cattaro_ and in varioud South Afican jails will level him up.
* __Chicago Zoo:__ If your players found Gunter's telegram, you might prompt them to investigate the corruption at the Chicago Zoo that would lead to the Zoo paying for poached animals.
* __Poaching:__ If your players are outraged by the poaching, you might send them back to South Africa to deal with poachers at the source.
