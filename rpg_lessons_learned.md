RPG Lessons Learned
===================

_Podcast by Brian (/u/tfradio) and Dusty (/u/dustinian)._



[Episode 012: Kobold Hall](https://www.tfradio.net/2017/07/23/rpg-lessons-learned-012-kobold-hall/)
----------------------------

Mike joins us to talk about running _Kobold Hall_ from the back of the fourth edition _Dungeon Master's Guide_. We share lessons we learned, including:

* Former GMs/DMs are demanding players!
* How we learned to think about Hit Points.
* The value of a ruthless GM/DM in encounters.
* Is first-level too early to take on a dragon?



Purpose
-------

We share the specific lessons we've learned from our own games.

We want rising DMs/GMs to learn from our successes and failures. By talking about specific situations in real games, we make the lessons we've learned clear and applicable.

Self-Promotion
--------------

I read the FAQ closely, and I recognize this is a self-promotion post. I want to make the 50% spam-ratio research easy for the mods. I love /r/rpg, and I've:

* Commented ([proof1](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/68ayyv/props_for_a_game_of_vampire_the_masquerade/dgxhqqr/), [proof2](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/5058l0/good_system_for_a_new_gm_with_an_emphasis_on/d71vdxu/), [proof3](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/42iy9l/the_worst_adventure_of_all_times_a_discussion/czbelsf/).
* And [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/49tmjy/made_a_bfrpg_starter_set_with_index_cards_markers/) [twice](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/3xqgjj/how_do_you_run_traps/).

I wanted to make sure I let the mods know that I think I'm over the 50% self-promotion threshold with this, my first self-promotion post.

I also waited until I felt like we were stable befire I posted this. We've got three episodes out there, and several more already recorded, with plenty of content for more!

Give us a listen, let us know what you think. Brian and I love doing this, so we're going to keep at it!
