Our Podcast: RPG Lessons Learned
================================

Premise
-------

Brian and I share the lessons we've learned from our own games.

Our Thing
---------

There are fantastic actual play podcasts and streams (One Shot, Godsfall, Shadow of the Cabal). There are fantastic Q&amp;A podcasts (Happy Jacks).

We wanted to do something a little different (we think), and talk about the lessons we've learned for ourselves as we've played.

Format
------

In each half-hour episode, we quickly re-cap a session, and discuss the lessons we learned.

Value Proposition
-----------------

We hope rising DMs/GMs can learn from our successes and failures. We hope that by talking about specific situations in real games, we make the lessons we learned clear and applicable for our listeners.

Self-Promotion
--------------

I read the FAQ closely, and I recognize this is a self-promotion post. I want to make the 50% spam-ratio research easy for the mods. I love /r/rpg, and I've:

* Commented ([proof1](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/68ayyv/props_for_a_game_of_vampire_the_masquerade/dgxhqqr/), [proof2](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/5058l0/good_system_for_a_new_gm_with_an_emphasis_on/d71vdxu/), [proof3](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/42iy9l/the_worst_adventure_of_all_times_a_discussion/czbelsf/).
* And [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/49tmjy/made_a_bfrpg_starter_set_with_index_cards_markers/) [twice](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/3xqgjj/how_do_you_run_traps/).

I wanted to make sure I let the mods know that I think I'm over the 50% self-promotion threshold with this, my first self-promotion post.

I also waited until I felt like we were stable befire I posted this. We've got three episodes out there, and several more already recorded, with plenty of content for more!

Give us a listen, let us know what you think. Brian and I love doing this, so we're going to keep at it!
