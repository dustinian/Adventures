## Storyteller

_Summary and advice._

### Pitch

The players’ characters wake as newly-turned thin-blooded Kindred abandoned by their sire. Now they must navigate un-life on their own.
	
### Secret

Cain turned the Players’ Characters... they’re second-generation vampires… new antediluvians. They will become incredibly powerful. And, as they grow into their power, Caine trusts they’ll decimate the vampire population. Gehenna is here, and the neonates are it’s harbingers.

Gehenna
How does this end?
	Encounter Cain…
When the characters wake, they discover cain in their midst. He’s come to speak with them.
Who are you?
* You know who I am.
* I changed you.
* A thousand names, But the first was Quayin. Remembered as Cain.
If questioned on (or using) any specific vampire term (Sire, Kindred, Kine, Antediluvian)...
* Meaningless words. I am gifted, and cursed. I have gifted and cursed others. I don’t care what my children’s children’s children call it.
Why did you change us?
* I haven’t passed on my gifts or curses in ten thousand years. I killed my children and my children’s children. I let my children’s children’s children live, play their games.
* But the world is changing. One way or another, the game will end soon.
* You are my gehenna. You will hasten the end.
What do you want?
* I want you to choose. What are we blessed and cursed in the new world? Humanity’s rulers, or its servants?
	

	Consequences

* Kill Aaron to become humanity’s rulers.
