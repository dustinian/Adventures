## Storyteller

_Summary and advice._

### Pitch

The players’ characters wake as newly-turned thin-blooded Kindred abandoned by their sire. Now they must navigate un-life on their own while learning who turned them... and why.
	
### Secret

Cain turned the Players’ Characters... they’re second-generation vampires… new antediluvians. They will become incredibly powerful. And, as they grow into their power, Cain trusts they’ll leave vampire society entirely changed... or destroyed.

Gehenna is here, and the neonates are it’s harbingers.

### Theme

This campaign explores what I see as a totally unsustainable mythology: vampires existing alongside modern technology.

Facial recognition, infrared cameras, incindiary ammunition... these technologies (and many others) would present insurmountable problems for a population of vampires. My favorite part of various vampire mythologies is how they overcome these...

...but what if they couldn't?

### Background

In my campaign, Cain sees the conflict... and he believes it's inevitable that either humans will wipe out all vampires, or vampires will subjugate all humans. But Cain doesn't trust himself to choose. He's been a silent observer to vampire and human history alike for millenia. And, while he's gained wisdom, he's lost perspective.

He's decided to create new vampires...

### This Document

These are my notes for a 5-session campaign that I ran. I outlined each session _after_ I had already ran the previous session. I was able to tailor each new session to fit the story my players wanted to tell.

I hope these notes help you run 

### Advice for the Storyteller

## Gehenna

__How does this end?__

### Encounter Cain...

When the characters wake, they discover Cain in their midst. He’s come to speak with them.

Who are you?

* You know who I am.
* I changed you.
* A thousand names, But the first was Quayin. Remembered as Cain.

If questioned on (or using) any specific vampire term (Sire, Kindred, Kine, Antediluvian)...

* Meaningless words. I am gifted, and cursed. I have gifted and cursed others. I don’t care what my children’s children’s children call it.

Why did you change us?

* I haven’t passed on my gifts or curses in ten thousand years. I killed my children and my children’s children. I let my children’s children’s children live, play their games.
* But the world is changing. One way or another, the game will end soon.
* You are my gehenna. You will hasten the end.

What do you want?

* I want you to choose. What are we blessed and cursed in the new world? Humanity’s rulers, or its servants?

### Cain’s Mission

* Kill Aaron to become humanity’s rulers.
* Kill Tirza to become humanity’s servants.
	
### Ending Narration

Ask the players to narrate what happens.
