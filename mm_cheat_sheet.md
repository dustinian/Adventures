Dice Rolls

All dice rolls in Mutants & Masterminds are done the same way.

- Roll a d20.
- Add or subtract any relevant modifiers.
- Compare the number to a Difficulty Class determined by the GM.

Average Difficulty Class is 10, a roll where you have a 50% chance of succeeding without any modifiers. A DC of 20 is challenging and a DC of 35 would require superhuman talent and luck. Regardless of modifiers, a roll of 1 indicates an automatic failure and a roll of 20 an automatic success.

Modifiers

Modifiers for your own abilities, skills and saving throws are listed on your character sheet. If you need to make a Power Check (that is, a check against one of your super powers rather than one of your skills or abilities) the modifier is the power’s rank.

The other type of modifier comes from the conditions you’re working under. For example, if use of a particular skill requires tools and you don’t have any to hand, you may have to take a penalty on your roll.

Attack Rolls and Defence

In combat, you attack by rolling the die and adding your Attack Bonus. The difficulty class is your target’s Defence. (Defence is 10 + Defence Bonus + any other modifiers.)

Half of the Defence Bonus is a Dodge Bonus, which is lost if the target is unable to move out of the way of an attack due to being surprised, stunned, tied up, etc.

Dealing Damage

Melee Damage = Strength modifier + any weapon bonuses + any other modifiers.

Ranged Weapon Damage = weapon bonus + any other modifiers.

Power Damage = power rank + any other modifiers.

A Critical Hit (a natural twenty on your attack roll) increases the attack’s damage bonus by five.

Taking Damage

When hit with a damaging attack, the target makes a Toughness saving throw. The Difficulty Class = 15 + the attack’s damage bonus + any other modifiers.

If the saving throw succeeds, the target takes no damage. If the save fails, the target is bruised. If the save fails by five or more, the target is both stunned and bruised. Failure by ten or more leaves the target staggered and stunned. Failure by fifteen or more leaves the target unconscious.

Common Conditions

Bruised: If a character fails a Toughness save, they are bruised. For each bruised condition on a character’s sheet, they suffer a further -1 penalty to Toughness saving throws against damage.

Stunned: If a character fails their Toughness save by 5 or more, they are stunned for a round. They are unable to take action, lose their Dodge Bonus, and suffer a further -2 penalty to their Toughness saves. This condition lasts until just before their attacker’s turn in the next round.

Staggered: A staggered character is barely holding on to consciousness. They can only take a single action each round.

Unconscious: An unconscious character is out of the fight until they recover.

Fatigued: Fatigued characters cannot move at full speed. They suffer a -2 penalty to effective Dexterity and Strength and a -1 penalty to Attack and Defence. A fatigued character who does something else strenuous becomes exhausted.

Exhausted: An exhausted character is near collapse. They move at half normal speed and suffer a -6 penalty to effective Strength and Dexterity as well as a -3 penalty to Attack and Defence. If they take another fatiguing action they fall unconscious.

Extra Effort and Hero Points

Characters can use extra effort to add a +2 bonus to any roll, move faster, use a power stunt they don’t normally have or various other nifty things at the cost of becoming fatigued.

PCs gain a Hero Point automatically at the start of each adventure. They can gain extra ones by doing cool things or otherwise impressing the GM. (No, you do not get an extra point for each icecream you buy me.) Hero Points can be used to cancel fatigue, re-roll any die, recover, etc. Hero Points expire at the end of each adventure.
