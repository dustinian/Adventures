## Background

### Introduction

_The Starving Sport_ is designed for one-shot, convention play. It's a scene-driven adventure that focuses on investigation, role-play, and combat while eliminating dungeon-style mapping.

### Summary

The PCs are hired by a worried dwarven parent to track down their lost child. They chase a series of clues until they uncover the kidnapper. The kidnapper then leads them to the horrible truth...

### Game Master Information

An exiled frost giant jarl has set himself up as an underworld boss in an abandoned warehoues on the waterfront. He has his agents kidnap human, elven, halfling, and (rarely) dwarven children to fight to the death for the amusement of the local thieve's guild.

#### Trap

Several boards have rotted through where the characters step off the ladder. Each character over 80 pounds that steps off the ladder has a 50% chance (1-3 on 1d6) of falling through the floor. A successful save vs. Death Ray (modified by Dexterity) results in no damage as the character catches him- or her-self chest-deep in the hole. A failed save results in 1d10 falling damage and a character-sized hole in the floor.
