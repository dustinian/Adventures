Release free rules.
-------------------

###Background

Many games offer abridged, "quick start" .PDFs, allowing potential customers to "try before [they] buy."

###Goal

Increase Core Rulebook sales.

###Objectives

Allow gamers to explore NGS by:

* __Running a one-shot__ before purchasing the core rulebook.
* __Recruiting new players__ without requiring an immediate purchase.

###Requirements

The free rules should contain, at a minimum:

* __Sample Characters:__ Four sample characters, one that emphasizes each _Mechanical Ability_.
* __Mechanical Abilities:__ Brief explanation of _Mechanical Abilities_.
  * __Unopposed Rolls:__ Brief explanation of _Unopposed Rolls_.
  * __Opposed Rolls:__ Brief explanation of _Opposed Rolls_.
* __Using Narrative Abilities:__ Brief explantion of _Narrative Abilities_.
* __Narrative Accolades:__ Brief description of awarding and using _Narrative Accolades_.
* __Advertisement:__ Full-page describing the additional content available in the core rulebook, including _Advancement Rules_, more _Narrative Abilities_, _Settings_, etc.

The free rules may also contain:

* __Character Creation:__ One method.
* __Narrative Abilities:__ Ten _Narrative Abilities_ to support _Character Creation_.
* __Scenario:__ One _Scenario_, compatible with the _Sample Characters_.

###Existing Quick Start Guide

The "NGS Quick Start Guide" that came out with the Kickstarter is probably overkill. It's 27 pages, which isn't easily printable. And it includes pretty much all of Character Creation, including advancement. I would:

* Cut out _Advancement_.
* Include only one method of _Character Creation_.
* Simplify the language around _Opposed Rolls_ and _Unopposed Rolls_.

###Itemized, Estimated Cost

|Category         |Description                     |Quantity|Measure     |Rate   |Subtotal  |
|:----------------|:-------------------------------|-------:|:-----------|------:|---------:|
|Internal Labor   |Write / edit rules.             |     8.0|Hours       | $22.35|   $178.80|
|External Labor   |Graphic design / layout.        |    16.0|Hours       | $29.06|   $464.96|
|Bandwidth        |10K downloads of 1MB file.      |     9.8|Gigabytes   |  $0.03|     $0.29|
|__TOTAL__        |                                |        |            |       |   
___Internal Labor__ estimated using the [2014 National Average Wage Index](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/AWI.html), which lists the national average salary in 2014 as $46,481.52 per year, or $22.35 per hour._
___External Labor__ estimated by adding a 30% markup to the Internal Labor estimate, or $29.06 per hour._
_All dollars are __USD__._
___Bandwidth__ estimated using [Amazon Web Services Pricing Sheet](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).

###Estimated Revenue

Let's assume a 2.5% conversion rate on 10,000 downloads in a year. At $9.99, that's an annual revenue of $2,497.50.



Participate in [Free RPG Day](http://www.freerpgday.com).
---------------------------------------------------------

This is dependent upon "release a free "Quick Start" rules package" above. Venture Land Games could release a short adventure (3-4 NPCs, 3-4 Pre-Generated Characters, Situation, Quick Start Rules) for [Free RPG Day](http://www.freerpgday.com). Now this is the first suggestion that costs money. Per the [Free RPG Day Sponsor Form](http://www.freerpgday.com/FreeRPGDaySponsorshipForm.pdf), the publisher would have to commit to printing a minimum of 700 copies of a minimum 16-page book, which could cost $2,100 (based on some quick Lulu pricing). So this migh tbe a suggestion for next year after NGS has some "safe" (read: no-cost) growth.



Create online community.
------------------------

NGS GMs need a place to collaborate, or share NGS stories, or ask questions about NGS. This subreddit is my attempt at that, but I'd gladly migrate my content somewhere else if Venture Land Games decides to open a Proboard, or a Tumblr, or whatever. But putting something "official" out there allows the community to support the game.

Ways Venture Land Games could publicize this subreddit (or some other online forum):

* Add a link from [venturelandgames.com](http://www.venturelandgames.com).
* Tweet the link from @VentureLandRPGs.



Encourage online community.
---------------------------



Leverage online community.
--------------------------



Participate in a [Bundle of Holding](http://www.bundleofholding.com).
---------------------------------------------------------------------

[Bundle of Holding](http://www.bundleofholding.com) releases one or two "bundles" of RPG .PDFs per month. Usually they'll release bundles of a lot of .PDFs for one game, but occasionally they'll release "indie" bundles of a bunch of different systems. NGS would fit into one of those rather nicely, and Bundle of Holding is quite popular. This would add quite a few folks interested in the NGS system.
