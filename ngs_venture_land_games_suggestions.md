Venture Land Games Suggestions
==============================



Release a free "Quick Start" rules package.
-------------------------------------------

Many games, including Fifth Edition, allow gamers to "try it before [they] buy it" with abridged .PDFs.

Releasing a set of "Quick Start" rules would allow:

* __A GM to try an NGS one-shot__ before purchasing the core rulebook.
* __A GM who's purchased the core rulebook to convert her game to NGS__ without asking each player to purchase a copy of the core rules. The GM could simply distribute the "Quick Start" .PDF to her players.
* __Players excited about NGS to legally share it with friends__ without any fear of copyright infringement.

In each case above, the "Quick Start" rules enable NGS to spread, and new gamers to become interested... which should lead to more NGS core rulebook purchases.

The "NGS Quick Start Guide" that came out with the Kickstarter is probably overkill. It's 27 pages, which isn't easily printable. And it includes pretty much all of Character Creation, including advancement. I'd cut out Advancement, and I'd only include method of Character Creation. And I'd simplify the all the language around opposed rolls and unopposed rolls.



Publicize this subreddit (or some other online forum).
------------------------------------------------------

NGS GMs need a place to collaborate, or share NGS stories, or ask questions about NGS. This subreddit is my attempt at that, but I'd gladly migrate my content somewhere else if Venture Land Games decides to open a Proboard, or a Tumblr, or whatever. But putting something "official" out there allows the community to support the game.

Venture Land Games could publicize this subreddit (or some other online forum) by:

* Adding a link from [venturelandgames.com](http://www.venturelandgames.com).
* Tweeting the link from
