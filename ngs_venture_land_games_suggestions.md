_Dollars are USD; detailed estimates are below._



DriveThruRPG copies to backers.
-------------------------------

_Send all Kickstarter backers a free copy of the NGS PDF through DriveThruRPG. You wouldn't lose any sales, since each recipient would already have DRM-free PDFs anyway, and you might drive positive reviews on DriveThruRPG!_

###Background

[DriveThruRPG](http://www.drivethrurpg) only allows users that own copies of a document to review it.

###Goal

Drive positive reviews on DriveThruRPG.

###Objectives

Encourage gamers to review NGS by:

* __Sending a voucher__ for a free copy of the rules through DriveThruRPG.
* __Sending out an update__ on [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com) encouraging users to claim the PDF and review it!

###Itemized, Estimated Cost

|Category         |Description                     |Quantity|Measure     |Rate   |Subtotal     |
|:----------------|:-------------------------------|-------:|:-----------|------:|------------:|
|Internal Labor   |Contact DTRPG to distribute.    |     8.0|Hours       | $22.35|      $178.80|
|__TOTAL__        |                                |        |            |       |  __$178.80__|

* ___Internal Labor__ estimated using the [2014 National Average Wage Index](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/AWI.html), which lists the national average salary in 2014 as $46,481.52 per year, or $22.35 per hour._
* _All dollars are __USD__._

###Estimated Revenue

Let's assume an additional 100 sales based solely on the reviews. At $9.99 that's an annual revenut of $999.



Release free rules.
-------------------

_Write and distribute a very short "quick start" guide on [venturelandgames.com](http://www.venturelandgames.com)._

###Background

Many games offer abridged, "quick start" .PDFs, allowing potential customers to "try before [they] buy."

###Goal

Increase Core Rulebook sales.

###Objectives

Allow gamers to explore NGS by:

* __Running a one-shot__ before purchasing the core rulebook.
* __Recruiting new players__ without requiring an immediate purchase.

###Requirements

####Minimum

The free rules should contain, at a minimum:

* __Sample Characters:__ Four sample characters, one that emphasizes each _Mechanical Ability_.
* __Mechanical Abilities:__ Brief explanation of _Mechanical Abilities_.
  * __Unopposed Rolls:__ Brief explanation of _Unopposed Rolls_.
  * __Opposed Rolls:__ Brief explanation of _Opposed Rolls_.
* __Using Narrative Abilities:__ Brief explantion of _Narrative Abilities_.
* __Narrative Accolades:__ Brief description of awarding and using _Narrative Accolades_.
* __Advertisement:__ Full-page describing the additional content available in the core rulebook, including _Advancement Rules_, more _Narrative Abilities_, _Settings_, etc.

####Preferred

The free rules may also contain:

* __Character Creation:__ One method.
* __Narrative Abilities:__ Ten _Narrative Abilities_ to support _Character Creation_.
* __Scenario:__ One _Scenario_, compatible with the _Sample Characters_.

####Existing Quick Start Guide

The "NGS Quick Start Guide" that came out with the Kickstarter is probably overkill. It's 27 pages, which isn't easily printable. And it includes pretty much all of Character Creation, including advancement. I would:

* Cut out _Advancement_.
* Include only one method of _Character Creation_.
* Simplify the language around _Opposed Rolls_ and _Unopposed Rolls_.

###Itemized, Estimated Cost

|Internal Labor   |Write / edit rules.             |     8.0|Hours       | $22.35|      $178.80|
|External Labor   |Graphic design / layout.        |    16.0|Hours       | $29.06|      $464.96|
|Bandwidth        |10K downloads of 1MB file.      |     9.8|Gigabytes   |  $0.03|        $0.29|
|__TOTAL__        |                                |        |            |       |  __$644.05__|

* ___Internal Labor__ estimated using the [2014 National Average Wage Index](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/AWI.html), which lists the national average salary in 2014 as $46,481.52 per year, or $22.35 per hour._
* ___External Labor__ estimated by adding a 30% markup to the Internal Labor estimate, or $29.06 per hour._
* _All dollars are __USD__._
* ___Bandwidth__ estimated using [Amazon Web Services Pricing Sheet](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).

###Estimated Revenue

Let's assume a 2.5% conversion rate on 10,000 downloads in a year. At $9.99, that's an annual revenue of $2,497.50.



Participate in [Free RPG Day](http://www.freerpgday.com).
---------------------------------------------------------

###Background

[Free RPG Day](http://www.freerpgday.com) is an annual RPG promotion; publishers and retailers team up to offer free RPG material to customers.

###Goal

Increase Core Rulebook sales.

###Objectives

Allow gamers to discover NGS by:

* __Taking home an NGS booklet__ that includes a brief rules summary and a one-shot.
* __Seeing NGS listed as a supporter__ on [www.freerpgday.com](http://www.freerpgday.com).

###Requirements

Based on the [2016 Sponsorship Form](http://www.freerpgday.com/FreeRPGDaySponsorshipForm.pdf), the relevant requirements are:

####Minimum

* 16 pages
* 700 copies
* Include quick start rules
* 50% never-before-seen material
* Include Free RPG Day logo on front or back cover
* Do not distribute anywhere else until 2-3 weeks after Free RPG Day
* Must arrive in Ft. Wayne, Indiana 6-8 weeks before Free RPG Day
* No MSRP or $0.00 MSRP

####Preferred

* Include adventure and pre-generated characters
* 10pt C1S color cover

###Itemized, Estimated Cost

|Shipping         |
|__TOTAL__        |

* _Note: Printing costs increase if multiples of 700 copies are provided, because the copies must then be shrink-wrapped in groups._

###Estimated Revenue




Encourage online community.
---------------------------

NGS GMs need a place to collaborate, or share NGS stories, or ask questions about NGS. This subreddit is my attempt at that, but I'd gladly migrate my content somewhere else if Venture Land Games decides to open a Proboard, or a Tumblr, or whatever. But putting something "official" out there allows the community to support the game.

Ways Venture Land Games could publicize this subreddit (or some other online forum):

* Add a link from [venturelandgames.com](http://www.venturelandgames.com).
* Tweet the link from @VentureLandRPGs.

###Estimated Revenue



Participate in a [Bundle of Holding](http://www.bundleofholding.com).
---------------------------------------------------------------------

[Bundle of Holding](http://www.bundleofholding.com) releases one or two "bundles" of RPG .PDFs per month. Usually they'll release bundles of a lot of .PDFs for one game, but occasionally they'll release "indie" bundles of a bunch of different systems. NGS would fit into one of those rather nicely, and Bundle of Holding is quite popular. This would add quite a few folks interested in the NGS system.

###Estimated Revenue



Acquire license to minor IP.
----------------------------

_Team up with an indie ebook author to offer the "offical" RPG (a setting for NGS with accompanying "quick start" rules) for their book series._

###Background

There are a lot of indie authors pushing very high-quality ebooks on [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com), and others. Examples:

* [Drew Hayes'](https://www.amazon.com/Drew-Hayes/e/B00C3NDBPS/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1473098657&sr=8-2-ent) [Fred, the Vampire Accountant](https://www.amazon.com/Utterly-Uninteresting-Unadventurous-Vampire-Accountant-ebook/dp/B00M6AM6Q8/ref=la_B00C3NDBPS_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1473098665&sr=1-3) series.

* [Lindsay Buroker's](https://www.amazon.com/Lindsay-Buroker/e/B004FSRHUE/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1473098908&sr=1-2-ent) [Dragon Blood](https://www.amazon.com/Balanced-Blades-Edge-Dragon-Blood-ebook/dp/B00JBVUJM8/ref=la_B004FSRHUE_1_35?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1473099016&sr=1-35&refinements=p_82%3AB004FSRHUE) series.

###Goal

Increase Core Rulebook sales.

###Objectives

Share your audience with an indie author, and gain the indie author's audience by:

* __Sending an update__ on Kickstarter communicating the new product/license and linking to the authors' book series.
* __Drafting an update__ for the author to send to subscribers communicating the new product with their readers.

* ___Legal Fees__ estimated using the [National Law Journal's 2014 Survey](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202636785489/Billing-Rates-Across-the-Country?slreturn=20160805134853)._
