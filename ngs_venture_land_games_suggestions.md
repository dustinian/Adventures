_All dollars are USD._
_Estimated cost is broken down into line items below._



_Labor costs estimated using the [2014 National Average Wage Index](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/AWI.html), which lists the national average salary in 2014 as $46,481.52 per year, or $22.35 per hour._

Release a free "Quick Start" rules package.
-------------------------------------------

Many games, including Fifth Edition, allow gamers to "try it before [they] buy" with abridged .PDFs.

Releasing a set of "Quick Start" rules would allow:

* __A GM to try an NGS one-shot__ before purchasing the core rulebook.
* __A GM who's purchased the core rulebook to convert her game to NGS__ without asking each player to purchase a copy of the core rules. The GM could simply distribute the "Quick Start" .PDF to her players.
* __Players excited about NGS to legally share it with friends__ without any fear of copyright infringement.

In each case above, the "Quick Start" rules enable NGS to spread, and new gamers to become interested... which should lead to more NGS core rulebook purchases.

The "NGS Quick Start Guide" that came out with the Kickstarter is probably overkill. It's 27 pages, which isn't easily printable. And it includes pretty much all of Character Creation, including advancement. I'd cut out Advancement, and I'd only include method of Character Creation. And I'd simplify the all the language around opposed rolls and unopposed rolls.



Publicize this subreddit (or some other online forum).
------------------------------------------------------

NGS GMs need a place to collaborate, or share NGS stories, or ask questions about NGS. This subreddit is my attempt at that, but I'd gladly migrate my content somewhere else if Venture Land Games decides to open a Proboard, or a Tumblr, or whatever. But putting something "official" out there allows the community to support the game.

Ways Venture Land Games could publicize this subreddit (or some other online forum):

* Add a link from [venturelandgames.com](http://www.venturelandgames.com).
* Tweet the link from @VentureLandRPGs.



Participate in Bundle of Holding.
---------------------------------

[Bundle of Holding](http://www.bundleofholding.com) releases one or two "bundles" of RPG .PDFs per month. Usually they'll release bundles of a lot of .PDFs for one game, but occasionally they'll release "indie" bundles of a bunch of different systems. NGS would fit into one of those rather nicely, and Bundle of Holding is quite popular. This would add quite a few folks interested in the NGS system.



Participate in Free RPG Day.
----------------------------

This is dependent upon "release a free "Quick Start" rules package" above. Venture Land Games could release a short adventure (3-4 NPCs, 3-4 Pre-Generated Characters, Situation, Quick Start Rules) for [Free RPG Day](http://www.freerpgday.com). Now this is the first suggestion that costs money. Per the [Free RPG Day Sponsor Form](http://www.freerpgday.com/FreeRPGDaySponsorshipForm.pdf), the publisher would have to commit to printing a minimum of 700 copies of a minimum 16-page book, which could cost $2,100 (based on some quick Lulu pricing). So this migh tbe a suggestion for next year after NGS has some "safe" (read: no-cost) growth.
