Level 0 Characters
==================

This essay considers approaches for rolling "Level 0" characters in the [Narrative Game System](http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/128522/NGS-The-Narrative-Game-System) (NGS) by [Venture Land Games](http://www.venturelandgames.com). This essay focuses on _Mechanical Abilities_.

Purpose
-------

This option allows:

* __GMs__ to roll NPCs that are weaker than even starting-level characters; this is useful if the GM wants the players to feel "powerful" immediately--a "superhero" game, for example.
* __Players__ to roll weaker PCs that can "grow into" a full-fledged PC.--an "origin story" one-shot or flashback, for example.



History
-------

* __1978, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons:__ "Unearthed Arcana"  discussed Level 0 magic users, and "Greyhawk Adventures" offered rules for Level 0 characters.
* __1980, Rolemaster:__ Level 0 characters are one of several character creation options.
* __1989, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, Second Edition:__ Statistics for Level 0 characters, such as saving throws, are included.



Summary
-------

In NGS, there are two components to every roll: the die and the priority. This gives us three approaches for "Level 0" house rules:

|          |                |    Priority    |        Priority          |
|:--------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:------------------------:|
|          |                | __No change.__ |       __Change.__        |
| __Die__  | __No change.__ |      N/A       |     Reduce priority.     |
| __Die__  |  __Change.__   |  Reduce die.   | Reduce die and priority. |



Reduce Die
----------

Reducing the die is an easy way to build a Level 0 character, and the die is a good, tactile reminder of the character's level.

###Roll

Keep thie _Priority_ distribution of +1, +2, +3, and +4, but roll d4s, rather than d6s.

###Run

Review the updated accuracy table for a breakdown of opposed rolls. 

|          |      |   d4   |  d4   |  d4   |  d4   |  d6   |  d6   |  d6   |  d6   |  d8   |  d8   |  d8   |  d8   |  d10  |  d10  |  d10  |  d10  |  d12  |  d12  |  d12  |  d12  |
|---------:|-----:|-------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
|          |      | __+1__ |__+2__ |__+3__ |__+4__ |__+1__ |__+2__ |__+3__ |__+4__ |__+1__ |__+2__ |__+3__ |__+4__ |__+1__ |__+2__ |__+3__ |__+4__ |__+1__ |__+2__ |__+3__ |__+4__ |
|  __d4__  |__+1__|   50%  |  19%  |   6%  |   0%  |  33%  |  13%  |   4%  |   0%  |  25%  |   9%  |   3%  |   0%  |  20%  |   8%  |   3%  |   0%  |  17%  |   6%  |   2%  |   0%  |
|  __d4__  |__+2__|   81%  |  50%  |  19%  |   6%  |  58%  |  33%  |  13%  |   4%  |  44%  |  25%  |   9%  |   3%  |  35%  |  20%  |   8%  |   3%  |  29%  |  17%  |   6%  |   2%  |
|  __d4__  |__+3__|   94%  |  81%  |  50%  |  19%  |  75%  |  58%  |  33%  |  13%  |  56%  |  44%  |  25%  |   9%  |  45%  |  35%  |  20%  |   8%  |  38%  |  29%  |  17%  |   6%  |
|  __d4__  |__+4__|  100%  |  94%  |  81%  |  50%  |  88%  |  75%  |  58%  |  33%  |  69%  |  56%  |  44%  |  25%  |  55%  |  45%  |  35%  |  20%  |  46%  |  38%  |  29%  |  17%  |

###Advance

Advance using the out-of-the-box NGS rules; it costs six XP to advance any _Mechanical Ability_ to a d6.

###Caution

d4s are underpowered. A d4+1 cannot beat any other die +4. For example: the _maxium_ roll of a d4+1 is 5; the _minimum_ roll of a d6+4 is 5; even if both roll 5, the tie-breaker is the priority. Review the accuracy table above and note the 0%. This is why d4s aren't used in NGS out-of-the-box; a d4 has a hard time offsetting the _Priority_ bonus.



Reduce Priority
---------------

Reducing _Priority_ is a little less underpowered than reducing die, but it also requires more rules massaging, especially since there are no out-of-the-box rules for advancing _Priority_.

###Roll

Keep the d6, but reduce all _Priority_ bonuses to +1.

###Run

Review the updated accuracy table for a breakdown of opposed rolls. 

|          |      |  d6   |  d6   |  d6   |  d6   |  d8   |  d8   |  d8   |  d8   |  d10  |  d10  |  d10  |  d10  |  d12  |  d12  |  d12  |  d12  |
|---------:|-----:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
|          |      |__+1__ |__+2__ |__+3__ |__+4__ |__+1__ |__+2__ |__+3__ |__+4__ |__+1__ |__+2__ |__+3__ |__+4__ |__+1__ |__+2__ |__+3__ |__+4__ |
|  __d6__  |__+1__|  50%  |  28%  |  17%  |   8%  |  38%  |  21%  |  13%  |   6%  |  30%  |  17%  |  10%  |   5%  |  25%  |  14%  |   8%  |   4%  |

###Advance

Upgrade _Priority_ bonuses by spending 1 XP per bonus point. Only upgrade priority until you have a +1, +2, +3, and +4. Characters should not, for example, advance to all +4s. Breaking the _Priority_ distribution of +1, +2, +3, and +4 will break the game in later levels. Once a character has the usual distribution of _Priority_, then the character should advance die normally.



Reduce Die and Priority
-----------------------

Reducing the _Die_ and the _Priority_ is pretty extreme. I'd recommend against this approach for a PC, and only for the weakest of NPCs... like a rat. Not a giant rat, just... a rat. Or a kitten. Or a duck. Heh: Duck Swarm.



Hack
----

If you're in the middle of a game, and you need an under-powered character on the double, apply a penalty to a "normal" character.

###Roll

1. Roll a "normal" character:
  * Use a d6 for every _Mechanical Ability_.
  * Distribute the standard _Priorities_ (+1, +2, +3, +4).
2. Select a penalty:
  * __-1:__ Not terrible, but not quite as good as the PCs... this character is learning the ropes, and could be quite deadly one day.
    * _Amateur_ with more enthusiasm than brains.
  * __-2:__ Dangerous in groups, but no threat one-on-one... this character is out of practice.
    * _Slacker_ who's never cut anything but corners.
  * __-3:__ Very young, very old, sick, or infirm... this character needs protection.
    * _Victim_ who's weakened by time, fate, or circumstance.

###Run

During play, apply the penalty to each of the character's rolls. For example:

| Penalty | Normal Roll |   Adjusted Roll   |
|:-------:|:-----------:|:-----------------:|
|   -1    |   1d6+1     | 1d6               |
|   -2    |   1d6+4     | 1d6+2             |
|   -3    |   1d6+1     | 1d6-2 (minimum 2) |

_Note: The minimum roll in NGS is 2. The penalty should never reduce a roll to less than 2. So if you roll 1d6-2, and you wind up with a -1, 0, or 1... the result is 2._

###Advance

When a character advances, remove the penalty one whole number at a time. Once the penalty is at zero, the character is "Level 1." Advance normally from here.

###Caution

This method is a "hack." It's great for getting a concept off the ground, but it's not perfect. If you intend to use this hack for more than one character or more than one session, consider the flaws, explanations, and mitigations below...

|          Flaw           | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| __Requires vigilence.__ | Round-after-round, you have to remember to apply the penalty, and you have to remember to say "2" even when you get a -1, 0, 1, etc.                                                                                                                | Temporalize. If a penalized NPC rarely appears, rarely "rolls," this is no problem. If a penalized PC is going to level up quickly, perhaps you're only running "Level 0" as the first session, this is no problem. |
| __Scales poorly.__      | Impossible situations can arise... 1d6+4 (minimum roll: 5) will always beat a 1d6-1 (maximum roll: 5).                                                                                                                                              | Acceptance. If you penalized this character for a reason, is it OK that he or she won't have a fighting chance in some situations? If not, you'll want to choose one of the integrated approaches below.            |
| __Advances rapidly.__   | Advancing a character from a penalty of -3 to -2, or even -1 to -0, is a big jump in power... it's a +1 gain in every _Mechanical Ability_ accross the board, while dvancing a single die is an _average_ +1 gain to only one _Mechanical Ability_. | Ration. Make this character earn his or her experience points. Or don't ration. If your aim is to be penalized for only a session or two, this flaw works in your favor!                                            |



Conclusion
----------

Hopefully this will allow you to create some underpowered PCs or NPCs for your NGS game.
