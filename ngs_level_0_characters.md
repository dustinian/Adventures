##Purpose

##History

* __Advanced Dungeons & Dragons:__ 
* __Dungeons & Dragons, 3.5e:__ 
* __Fate:__ 
* __Savage Worlds:__ 
* __Apocalypse World:__ 
* __Cortex Plus:__ 

##Hack

If you're in the middle of a game, and you need an under-powered NPC on the double, just apply a penalty to a "normal" character:

1. Roll a "normal" character:
  a. Use a d6 for every mechanical ability.
  b. Distribute the standard _Priorities_ (+1, +2, +3, +4).
2. Select a penalty:
  * __-1:__ Not terrible, but not quite as good as the PCs... this NPC is learning the ropes, and could be quite deadly one day.
    * Amateur with more enthusiasm than brains.
  * __-2:__ Dangerous in groups, but no threat one-on-one... this NPC is out of practice.
    * Slacker who's never cut anything but corners.
  * __-3:__ 
3. During play, apply the penalty to each of the NPC's rolls:
  * Examples:
    * 1d6+4 becomes 1d6+4-1.
  * _Note: The penalty should never reduce a roll to less than two. Two is the minimum roll in NGS.


##Integrated Approaches

In NGS, there are two components to every roll: the die and the priority. This gives us three "integrated" approaches for "Level 0" house rules:

|          |                |    Priority    |        Priority         |
|:--------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:-----------------------:|
|          |                | __No change.__ |       __Change.__       |
| __Die__  | __No change.__ |      N/A       |     Lower priority.     |
| __Die__  |  __Change.__   |   Lower die.   | Lower die and priority. |
