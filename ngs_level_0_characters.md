##Hack

If you're in the middle of a game, and you need an under-powered character on the double, apply a penalty to a "normal" character.
###Roll

1. Roll a "normal" character:
  * Use a d6 for every _Mechanical Ability_.
  * Distribute the standard _Priorities_ (+1, +2, +3, +4).
2. Select a penalty:
  * __-1:__ Not terrible, but not quite as good as the PCs... this character is learning the ropes, and could be quite deadly one day.
    * _Amateur_ with more enthusiasm than brains.
  * __-2:__ Dangerous in groups, but no threat one-on-one... this character is out of practice.
    * _Slacker_ who's never cut anything but corners.
  * __-3:__ Very young, very old, sick, or infirm... this character needs protection.
    * _Victim_ who's weakened by time, fate, or circumstance.

###Run

During play, apply the penalty to each of the character's rolls. For example:

| Penalty | Normal Roll |   Adjusted Roll   |
|:-------:|:-----------:|:-----------------:|
|   -1    |   1d6+1     | 1d6               |
|   -2    |   1d6+4     | 1d6+2             |
|   -3    |   1d6+1     | 1d6-2 (minimum 2) |

_Note: The minimum roll in NGS is 2. The penalty should never reduce a roll to less than 2. So if you roll 1d6-2, and you wind up with a -1, 0, or 1... the result is 2._

###Advance

When a character advances, remove the penalty one whole number at a time. Once the penalty is at zero, the character is "Level 1." Advance normally from here.

###Flaws

This method is a "hack." While it's great for getting a concept off the ground, it's not perfect. If you intend to use this hack for more than one character or more than one session, consider the flaws, explanations, and mitigations below...

|          Flaw           | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| __Requires vigilence.__ | Round-after-round, you have to remember to apply the penalty, and you have to remember to say "2" even when you get a -1, 0, 1, etc.                                                                                                                | Temporalize. If a penalized NPC rarely appears, rarely "rolls," this is no problem. If a penalized PC is going to level up quickly, perhaps you're only running "Level 0" as the first session, this is no problem. |
| __Scales poorly.__      | Impossible situations can arise... 1d6+4 (minimum roll: 5) will always beat a 1d6-1 (maximum roll: 5).                                                                                                                                              | Acceptance. If you penalized this character for a reason, is it OK that he or she won't have a fighting chance in some situations? If not, you'll want to choose one of the integrated approaches below.            |
| __Advances rapidly.__   | Advancing a character from a penalty of -3 to -2, or even -1 to -0, is a big jump in power... it's a +1 gain in every _Mechanical Ability_ accross the board, while dvancing a single die is an _average_ +1 gain to only one _Mechanical Ability_. | Ration. Make this character earn his or her experience points. Or don't ration. If your aim is to be penalized for only a session or two, this flaw works in your favor!                                            |



##Integrated Approaches

In NGS, there are two components to every roll: the die and the priority. This gives us three "integrated" approaches for "Level 0" house rules:

|          |                |    Priority    |        Priority          |
|:--------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:------------------------:|
|          |                | __No change.__ |       __Change.__        |
| __Die__  | __No change.__ |      N/A       |     Reduce priority.     |
| __Die__  |  __Change.__   |  Reduce die.   | Reduce die and priority. |
