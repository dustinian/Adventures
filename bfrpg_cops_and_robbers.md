#Cops and Robbers

A one-page supplement designed for use with the [Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game](http://www.basicfantasy.org).

By Dustinian Camburides

##Introduction

The [Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game](http://www.basicfantasy.org) (BFRPG) is intended to run a high medieval fantasy game, so--naturally--it's going to take some customization to run a game with firearms and limited magic. This supplement assumes some familiarity with the BFRPG rules as written. I strongly recommend running a few sessions of the [Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game](http://www.basicfantasy.org)--or at least building a few characters--before using these rules.

##Short, Short Version

* Calculate AC as 11 + DEX + CON (CON is optional).
* Substitute light crossbows (1d6 damage) for small firearms (pistols).
* Substitute heavy crossbows (1d8 damage) for large firearms (rifles, shotguns).
* Use fantastic and magical mechanics, but change the descriptions (exa: A _Fireball_ spell becomes a Molotov Cocktail).

##Rolling Characters

For the most part, players should roll characters according the rules in the _Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game_.

__Fantasy Races:__ Fantasy races should be used "as-is." In fact, the Game Master may opt to keep elves, dwarves, and halflings in his or her setting unchanged. But, if not, players can still enjoy the special abilities and saving throws of a race by giving their character a corresponding "origin." For example, a character that wants to play as a dwarf may be a "human" physically, but claim the "origin" of "coal miner" or "construction worker" to justify their Darkvision and passage/trap/construction detection. Note that characters that do this must adhere to the race's restrictions, and do not get the "Human" special abilities.

__Fantasy Classes:__ Fantasy classes should be used "as-is." Though perhaps a bit of re-naming is in order:

* __Clerics:__ Priests, Doctors (M.D.), Medics, etc.
* __Fighters:__ Thugs, Boxers, Toughs, etc.
* __Magic-Users:__  Scientists, Doctors (Ph.D.), Professors, etc.
	* _Note: A specific discussion on magic is below.
* __Thieves:__ Burglars, Spies, Ninjas, etc.

__Currency:__ If you want your prices to feel more 1920s/1930s/1940s, cut starting gold and all equipment prices in half. If you want your prices to feel more 1980s/1990s/2000s, double starting gold and all equipment prices. But a characters' initial purchasing power should remain unchanged.

__Equipment:__ Try to find the closest piece of _Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game_ equipment you can, and use that cost/weight/damage. For example, a "canteen" should cost $1 since a "wineskin/waterskin" costs $1. A "Flashlight" should cost $5 because a "lantern" costs $5. A "baseball bat" is a good stand in for a "mace." Etc. _Note: Specific discussions of armor and firearms are below._

##Armor Class

__Calculation:__ Since it's impractical for a 1920's character to purchase and wear plate mail, Armor Class should be calculated as: 11 + DEX + CON (CON is optional), where DEX and CON are the Dexterity and Constitution Modifiers. _Note: Round down._

|     |Value                           |Explanation                                      |Relevant Quote     |
|:---:|:-------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|:------------------|
|     |11                              |Base Armor Class for all characters.             |                   |
|  +  |Dexterity Modifier              |Character's ability to dodge, duck, and weave.   |Ha! Missed me!     |
|  +  |Constitution Modifier (Optional)|Character's ability to shrug off a "flesh wound."|'Tis but a scratch.|

__Cover and Concealment:__ If you're worried that this relatively low Armor Class will make characters too easy to hit, remember the _cover_ rules in the _Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game, 3rd Edition_ on page 47. Even Phillip Marlowe and Sam Spade kept their heads down during a shoot-out!

__Camouflage:__ Characters who wear camouflage or dark clothing should get a +2 bonus to Armor Class, but this bonus is _situational_. If the character gives away their position or the lights come on, the jig is up.

__Higher-Level Play:__ Characters should add an extra point to Armor Class every 6 levels. These extra points would stand in for the +1, +2, and +3 magical armor a character might collect throughout his/her career. This will help offset increases in enemies' Hit Die (and therefore their Attack Bonuses).

__Bullet-Proof Vests:__ Characters who decide to wear modern body armor into a combat situation will receive 1 Hit Die of additional hit points to be rolled and tracked by the Game Master. Once these hit points are gone, the armor is useless and must be replaced. Modern body armor does not affect a character's Armor Class.

##Firearms

Rather than creating a lengthy firearms table, let's keep this simple: Light Crossbows stand in for pistols, and Heavy Crossbows stand in for anything bigger.

|Weapon        |Damage|Range        |Stands in for...                                                      |
|:-------------|-----:|------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Light Crossbow|   1d6|60'/120'/180'|Any pistol.                                                           |
|Heavy Crossbow|   1d8|80'/160'/240'|Anything bigger (rifles, shotguns, machine guns, and sub-machine guns).|

__Reloading:__ Characters empty their weapon every DEX &times; 2 attacks, where DEX is the character's Dexterity Modifier. This represents a higher-dexterity character's ability to "place" his or her shots and conserve ammunition. Once a weapon is empty, the character must spend a full round to reload it.

__Ammunition:__ In these rules, an "attack" does not model the shot-for-shot operation of a firearm. A character using a pistol may squeeze off three quick rounds, but only makes one attack role that may deal 1d6 damage. Therefore, ammunition should be tracked by the number of times a character "empties" his or her weapon and reloads.

__Customizing Firearm Mechanics:__ Players may wish to customize their character's firearm mechanics to fit the specific firearm they'd like to simulate. To customize a pistol modeled on the Light Crossbow, a player may remove one point of accuracy (-1 to Ranged Attack Bonus, -33% range) to gain a point of damage (1d6+1) or vice versa. To customize a weapon based on the Heavy Crossbow, a character may do the same, but with up to 2 points. Examples:

|Weapon           |Attack Modifier|Damage|Range               |
|:----------------|--------------:|-----:|:-------------------|
|.44 Magnum       |             -1| 1d6+1|-33%: 40'/80'/120'  |
|.22 Target Pistol|             +1| 1d6-1|+33%: 80'/160'/240' |
|Sawed-Off Shotgun|             -2| 1d8+2|-66%: 25'/50'/75'   |
|Hunting Rifle    |             +2| 1d8-2|+66%: 130'/260'/390'|

__Bazookas, Dynamite, Grenades, etc.:__ The "Fireball" spell can be used to simulate explosives. Explosives should require a full round to reload (in the case of the bazooka) or prepare to throw (in the case of dynamite or a grenade). Don't forget the "Grenade-Like Missiles" and "Missiles that Miss" rules in the _Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game, 3rd Edition_ on page 47.

##Magic

Magic should be used largely "as-is." Game Masters may opt to:

* Remove magic entirely (think "Sam Spade").
  * _Note: Removing magic from the setting doesn't mean players can't roll wizards and cast fireballs. But call that wizard a "rogue chemistry teacher" and have him throw a "Molotov cocktail." Characters should adhere to spellbook limitations, but instead of saying "I only have two of these spell slots per day," characters might say "I can only fit two of these babies in my backpack!" Instead of saying "I cast healing word," characters might say: "I administer first aid."_
* Keep magic, but it's rare (think "Indiana Jones" or "H.P. Lovecraft).
* Keep magic, and it's common (think "Star Wars").
