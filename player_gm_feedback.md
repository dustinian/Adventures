Corrective Feedback
===================

_Some of the concepts in this essay were sourced from the [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org) article on [Corrective Feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrective_feedback) and the [WebMD](http://www.webmd.com) article on [Breaking Bad Habits](http://www.webmd.com/balance/features/3-easy-steps-to-breaking-bad-habits)._

__Why should I read this?__ Do you have a great gaming group, except Chad just can't take role play seriously? Are most of your players driving your campaign forward, but Tina can't be bothered to remember what happened last week? Does everyone have a good time, but Jeff just can't stop making inappropriate jokes that alienate Thomas. If so, this essay is for you.

__Why did you write this?__ Are you bewildered by the constant questions about "problem players" and "that guy DMs" that trickle onto the frontpage of your favorite rpg subreddit? Do you shout "just talk them like adults" when your favoriet rpg podcast answers yet another e-mail about how to address a group issue? Well, I used to, as well. But then I asked myself... why is this such a common question when the answer seems so easy? Well, I'm a mid-30s family man with a job managing people. I've matured a lot, and I have a job managing people. I've had a lot of "difficult conversations." But I used to be an awkwardly tall teenager with bad acne and no social skills. And that version of me... would have asked these very same questions.

__Goals:__ I hope this essay expands your mental "feedback" toolset. Basically, I want to lay out a few strategies for you, so that when you plan a "difficult conversation" with a "problem player," you feel like you're prepared.

1. Diagnose the problem.
------------------------


1. __Diagnose__ the problem.
2. __
* Create document with strategies to give feedback to players and DMs.
  * Challenge players. Hey guys, next time let's try...
  * Phrase negatives as a positive. "You're great with ranged weapons; I'd love to see you try playing a Ranger," or "Hey, sinc e you're very experienced, would you mind playing a Wizard so the others can see how that works?" instead of "We're sick to death of you playing Rogue."
  * Give in. If a player's beeing goofy, and nobody else has a problem with, run a goofy game.
  * Reward and encourage the behavior that you want.
