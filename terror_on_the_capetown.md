#Terror on the Capetown

There's been a murder at sea... and whatever committed it was no man.

An adventure for three player characters at level two.

Designed for use with the [Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game](http://www.basicfantasy.org).

##Setting Rules

The [Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game](http://www.basicfantasy.org) rules-as-written are intended to run a high medieval fantasy game (think Tolkein). So, naturally, it's going to take some custom rules to run a game in the 1920's. These rules assume some familiarity with the rules as written. I strongly recommend running a few sessions of the [Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game](http://www.basicfantasy.org), or at least building a few characters, before attempting this module.

###Armor Class

__Calculation:__ Since it's impractical for a 1920's character to purchase and wear plate mail, Armour Class should be calculated as: 11 + DEX + (.5 &times; CON). Round _down_.

|     |Value                                     |Explanation                                      |Relevant Quote     |
|:---:|:-----------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|:------------------|
|     |11                                        |Base Armor Class for all characters.             |                   |
|  +  |Character's Dexterity Modifier            |Character's ability to dodge, duck, and weave.   |Ha! Missed me!     |
|  +  |Half the Character's Constitution Modifier|Character's ability to shrug off a "flesh wound."|'Tis but a scratch.|

__Cover and Concealment:__ If you're worried that this relatively low AC score will make characters easy to hit, remember the _cover_ rules in the _Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game_ on page 00. Even Phillip Marlow and Sam Spade kept their heads down during a shoot-out.

__Camoflage:__ Characters who take the time to wear camoflage or dark clothing should get a +2 bonus to Armor Class, but this bonus is _situational_. If the character gives away their position or the lights come on, the jig is up.

__Higher-Level Play:__ This calculation may require house-ruling at higher-level play. A GM might allow his players to add one-third or one-half their level as the enemies' Hit Die and Ranged Attack Bonuse increases.

###Firearms

Rather than creating a lengthy firearms table, we're going to keep this simple: Light Crossbows stand in for pistols, and Heavy Crossbows stand in for anything bigger.

|Weapon        |Damage|Stands in for...                                                      |
|:-------------|-----:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Light Crossbow|   1d6|Any pistol.                                                           |
|Heavy Crossbow|   1d8|Anything bigger (rifles, shotguns, machine guns, and submachine guns).|

__Reloading:__ Depending on the firearm being modeled, one "attack" may take multiple "shots." This "burst" of fire still only does 1d6 or 1d8 damage by weapon type, but it makes tracking ammunition tricky. Therefore, the GM should assume that characters empty their weapons every DEX &times; 2 rounds. This represents a higher-dexterity character's ability to "place" his or her shots and conserve ammunition. Once a weapon is empty, it takes one full round for the character to reload.

__Customizing Firearms:__

####Trap

Several boards have rotted through where the characters step off the ladder. Each character over 80 pounds that steps off the ladder has a 50% chance (1-3 on 1d6) of falling through the floor. A successful save vs. Death Ray (modified by Dexterity) results in no damage as the character catches him- or her-self chest-deep in the hole. A failed save results in 1d10 falling damage and a character-sized hole in the floor.
